## Summary
This is an interview between Andrew Ross Sorkin and Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, conducted at what appears to be a major business conference (likely the DealBook Summit based on context). The conversation covers the state of AI development, whether we're in an AI bubble, Anthropic's business model and revenue growth (from $100M to potentially $8-10B in three years), chip export policy to China, AI regulation debates, and the future impact of AI on jobs. Amodei presents himself as both highly optimistic about AI's potential while being notably concerned about risks that require careful management.

## Key Insights

### On AI Progress and Expectations
- Amodei is not surprised by AI's current economic impact—he predicted in 2014 that AI would become central to the economy, national security, and scientific research
- He was surprised to find himself leading one of the major AI companies
- The scaling laws he and colleagues documented have been consistently predictive for 12+ years
- Models improve at everything simultaneously as compute and data increase—coding, science, biomedicine, law, finance, manufacturing

### On Business Model and Growth
- Anthropic's revenue trajectory: $0→$100M (2023), $100M→$1B (2024), $1B→$8-10B (projected 2025)
- Enterprise focus provides better margins and a more stable business model than consumer-focused competitors
- API business is surprisingly sticky—companies have difficulty switching models due to downstream customers, prompting differences, and model personalities
- The enterprise approach allows Anthropic to avoid the "code red" mentality of competitors fighting for consumer market share

### On the AI Bubble Question
- Technologically, Amodei is "one of the most bullish people around"
- Economically, there are legitimate concerns about timing and overextension
- The core challenge: 1-2 year lag time in building data centers creates a "cone of uncertainty" about future revenue vs. compute purchases
- Conservative planning: Anthropic plans for the lower end of revenue projections (10th percentile scenarios)
- Some players are "yoloing"—pulling the risk dial too far (implied reference to competitors)

### On Vendor Financing and "Circular Deals"
- These deals can make sense: If you need $50B for a gigawatt of compute with a 5-year lifespan, investor capital can bridge the gap
- The key is whether revenue projections are realistic
- Anthropic has done some of these deals but at a smaller scale
- Risk comes from stacking too many such deals requiring unrealistic future revenue

### On Chip Depreciation and Competition
- There's no fixed depreciation schedule—chips work for years but lose value as faster/cheaper chips emerge
- This can happen within a year of purchase
- Anthropic makes conservative assumptions about chip value decline

### On Model Competition
- Google and OpenAI are fighting primarily over consumer markets
- Anthropic's enterprise focus means they're "going in a different direction"
- Opus 4.5 is "hands down" the best model for coding according to most observers
- Models genuinely have different personalities and capabilities based on what they're optimized for
- General intelligence doesn't mean convergence—specialization exists alongside it

### On AGI Timeline and Definition
- Amodei rejects terms like "AGI" and "ASI" as poorly defined
- There is no singular threshold—just a continuous exponential improvement
- Scaling will get us there, with occasional small modifications
- Internal Anthropic employees now use Claude Code to write first drafts of all code, only editing rather than writing
- Future prediction: "a country of geniuses in a data center"

### On China Policy and National Security
- Strongly opposes selling advanced chips to China—view unchanged despite Nvidia partnership
- AI is a national security issue, not an economic/trade issue like 5G or internet
- "Democracies need to get there first"—this is "common sense" and an "imperative"
- The country that first develops powerful AI could have overwhelming intelligence, defense, and economic advantages
- Authoritarian countries could use AI for perfect surveillance states

### On AI Regulation
- Rejects David Sacks' accusation of "regulatory capture" and "fear-mongering"
- Points out he was writing AI safety papers in 2016, before having a company
- Bills Anthropic supports (like SB53) exempt companies under $500M revenue
- Opposes 10-year moratoriums on AI regulation without federal framework
- The actual researchers building AI are worried about risks—unlike some investors and commentators
- "Saying we won't regulate for 10 years is like ripping out the steering wheel"

### On Surveillance and Democracy
- Warns against concentration of power in democracies, not just authoritarian states
- Formulation: "Aggressively use AI for national security except in ways that would make us more like our authoritarian adversaries"
- "We need to beat them but not become them"

### On Jobs and Economic Impact
- Three levels of response needed:
  1. **Private sector**: Companies can create value (not just efficiency)—humans with 10x leverage can do 100x work
  2. **Government involvement**: Retraining programs, possibly tax policy, fiscal intervention
  3. **Long-term societal restructuring**: Keynes' vision of 15-20 hour work weeks; finding meaning outside work
- Current models may increase productivity 1.6% annually; could grow to 5-10% annually
- This creates a "big pie" that should be distributed to those not benefiting
- Warning about job displacement is "the first step towards solving" it

## Main Arguments or Thesis

1. **AI technology is on track**: Scaling laws continue to hold, models keep improving at all tasks, and the technology will deliver massive economic value.

2. **Economic risks are real but manageable**: The "cone of uncertainty" around revenue timing creates genuine risk, but responsible companies can navigate it with conservative planning. Some companies are taking excessive risks.

3. **Enterprise is a better business model**: Consumer-focused companies fight over engagement; enterprise-focused companies build sticky relationships and sustainable revenue.

4. **National security trumps economics on chip policy**: AI is not analogous to previous tech revolutions—it's a singular capability with singular implications. Democracies must maintain the advantage.

5. **Regulation is necessary and compatible with innovation**: The people actually building AI understand the risks. Bills can be crafted to protect startups while managing genuine dangers.

6. **Job displacement is coming but solvable**: Warning about it enables solutions. Multiple levels of response—from corporate to governmental to societal restructuring—will be needed.

## Notable Quotes or Highlights

**On scaling and capability:**
> "I've had internal people at Anthropic say, 'I don't write any code anymore. I don't open up an editor and write code. I just let Claude Code write the first draft and all I do is edit it.' We had never reached that point before."

**On risk-taking:**
> "There are some players who are yoloing, who pull the risk dial too far."

**On future AI capability:**
> "Eventually the models are going to get to the point where they look like a country of geniuses in a data center."

**On China policy:**
> "If we sell these chips to China, that just makes it more likely they will get there first. It's common sense."

**On balancing security and values:**
> "We should aggressively use them in every possible way except in the ways that would make us more like our authoritarian adversaries. We need to beat them but we need to not do the things that would cause us to become them."

**On regulation critics:**
> "Saying that for 10 years we won't regulate this technology—it's like saying I'm driving a car, I'm going to rip out the steering wheel because I don't need to steer for 10 years."

**On warnings about AI:**
> "I warn about these things not to be a prophet of doom, but because warning about them is the first step towards solving them. If we don't warn about them, we'll just blindly walk into the landmine."

## Practical Takeaways

1. **For investors**: Look beyond pure growth numbers to business model quality—enterprise-focused AI companies may have more durable advantages than consumer-focused ones

2. **For business leaders**: When deploying AI, balance efficiency gains (doing same for less) with value creation (doing more with leverage)—the latter creates more jobs

3. **For policymakers**: AI regulation should exempt small companies while addressing genuine risks; blanket moratoriums are inadequate

4. **For workers**: Entry-level jobs face significant disruption; seek roles that provide leverage alongside AI rather than competing with it

5. **For society**: Begin thinking about alternative sources of meaning and restructured relationships with work
