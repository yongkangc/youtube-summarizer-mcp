## Summary

This video features Adrian, who grew from a new grad to a Principal Engineer (IC8) at Meta over approximately 14 years. The interview, hosted by Ryan, covers Adrian's complete career journey including his work on the early data science team, building AB testing for Instagram, creating the Bento notebook platform, a brief stint at Clubhouse during its viral growth period, and his work on smart glasses/wearables. The conversation provides deep insights into how to navigate promotions at a large tech company, the importance of building trust and relationships, and practical strategies for taking calculated risks in your career.

## Key Insights

### Early Career & Identity
- Adrian was pre-allocated to Facebook's "data science" team in 2011-2012, which was different from modern data science—focused on building tools for AB testing, data pipelines, and measurement at scale
- His manager Cameron Marlo gave crucial early advice: "Software engineers have power at this company. You are a software engineer. Don't pigeonhole yourself into a category that is not the most important job at the company"
- Despite various titles (research scientist, data scientist), Adrian always considered himself a software engineer first

### Building AB Testing for Instagram (IC4 → IC5)
- Instagram was acquired in September 2012 with only ~30 core team members
- Adrian identified an opportunity: Instagram had no AB testing system
- When leadership said they had "bigger fish to fry" (migrating from AWS to Facebook infra), Adrian built it anyway with PM air cover
- Created a "hacky" solution: custom Facebook API endpoint that logged exposures over the internet from AWS
- Got his IC5 promotion as a surprise—he didn't even know promotions existed at the time
- **Key lesson**: Not joining Instagram officially was his "biggest career mistake" (in the Bitcoin-regret sense)—colleagues who joined went on to hit IC7-10 faster

### Building Bento Notebook Platform (→ IC7/TLM2)
- Around 2015, frustrated by poor developer experience for data pipelining and ML work
- Started building a library that reduced 300 lines of boilerplate code to 20 lines
- Expanded to building Bento, a notebook platform based on Jupyter
- **Growth strategy that worked**:
  1. Targeted boot camp/data camp for new hires—new employees don't know legacy systems
  2. Provided support for legacy systems to build trust, then gradually converted users
  3. Got buy-in from analytics leadership (Alex Schulz, Brady Laach)
- Transitioned to Tech Lead Manager role organically: "The team needed a manager. I ended up being the manager"

### Risk-Taking Framework
- Told his manager: "I'm going to take 2-3 months to hack on this. If it doesn't pan out by April, I'll find another project to save the half"
- **Critical advice**: Overcommunicate and align with your manager on expectations before taking risks
- "If you're not aligned on what is expected of you with your manager, that is a problem"
- Get explicit agreement that exploration is part of your job for that period

### Failed Startup Attempt
- Left Meta after 7 years as IC7 thinking he could build Bento externally
- Realized he wasn't an entrepreneur: "In order to be a successful entrepreneur, you need to be able to delegate the hard stuff... whenever something became interesting, I would have to find someone else to do it"
- Ended up taking a sabbatical instead, traveled the world

### Boomerang #1 & Clubhouse
- Returned to Meta in 2020 because of a specific manager (James Pierce) he respected
- Left after 7 months for Clubhouse during its viral moment
- Clubhouse was ~10-11 people when he joined
- Built AB testing (again) and introduced ML for notification filtering

### Boomerang #2 & Smart Glasses (→ IC8)
- Returned to Meta specifically to work with manager Vincent Hardy on Ray-Ban Stories
- Spent first year doing data consulting to build trust, then asked to switch to product work
- Eventually became responsible for all user experiences across a device line (working with 35+ PMs)

### IC8 (Principal Engineer) Promotion Strategy
- Unlike earlier promotions, this required active consensus-building
- **Process**:
  1. Wrote substantial portion of his own promo packet with manager's help
  2. Went to multiple VPs early: "This is the work I've been doing. Would you be supportive of the promotion?"
  3. Found a critical D2 (director) and asked for monthly mentorship conversations
  4. First cycle was just "feeling the water"—manager didn't officially put him up
  5. Second cycle succeeded because everyone already had context
- "You need to have the impact in the underlying work, but then it is also way easier to build the consensus ahead of time"

### Scope & Avoiding "Scope Stealing"
- Didn't take the Uber TL role from someone—identified adjacent scope (experiences specifically) that he could own
- Communicated constantly: "Hey, I am very excited about this space. Do you mind if I help with this?"
- Eventually asked to be "blessed with a little label" after doing the work for a year
- **Key distinction**: Taking something off someone's plate is only "stealing" if you're not talking to them about it

### Ramping Up in New Domains
- Use "BOFS strategy": social network exploration—talk to people, ask who else to talk to
- Don't be afraid to ask "dumb questions" when you're new
- Get hands dirty: checked out firmware code even though he never officially worked on it
- Pick a hard problem to solve and learn by doing

## Main Arguments or Thesis

1. **Software engineering is the core identity that carries weight**—regardless of specialized titles like "data scientist" or "research scientist"

2. **Bottoms-up agency creates opportunities**—the early Facebook culture of hackathons and self-driven projects enabled career growth

3. **Promotions require both substance and socialization**—especially at senior levels, you need the work AND pre-built consensus

4. **Overcommunication is the key to taking risks**—never surprise your manager, align on expectations explicitly

5. **Being a generalist/well-rounded engineer is valuable**—"Specialization is for insects" (Robert Heinlein quote Adrian lives by)

6. **Relationships are the foundation of career growth**—every major career move came through someone Adrian knew and had built trust with

## Notable Quotes or Highlights

> "Software engineers have power at this company. You are a software engineer. Don't pigeonhole yourself into a category that is not the most important job at the company." — Cameron Marlo to Adrian early in his career

> "I had no idea promotions existed at that point. I was like a little IC4 who was completely naive, just working on things because I was excited about them."

> "Hey manager, I'm not going to do what my job is and what the team is doing because I think there's an opportunity there." — Adrian's approach to risk-taking

> "You need to have the impact in the underlying work, but then it is also way easier to build the consensus ahead of time."

> "Taking something off someone's plate doesn't mean that you're stealing from them. Or it is if you're not talking to them about it."

> "A rising tide lifts all boats... When you build trust and respect with people, eventually if you have a need, that person is going to be there for you. You don't do that in order for them to be there for you. You just are a good person."

> "The way you maximize your luck is you maximize the surface area for luck. Take more shots."

> "Specialization is for insects." — Robert Heinlein quote that Adrian lives by

## Practical Takeaways

1. **For IC4-5 engineers**: Focus on building things you're excited about. Promotions may come as a natural result of impactful work.

2. **For taking risks**: Explicitly align with your manager. Say "I want to spend X months exploring this. If it doesn't work, I'll pivot." Get that agreement documented as your expectation.

3. **For driving adoption of new tools**: Target new hires who don't know legacy systems, provide support for legacy users to build trust, and get executive sponsorship.

4. **For senior promotions (IC7+)**: 
   - Write your own promo packet
   - Socialize early with decision-makers
   - Find a critical stakeholder and ask for mentorship
   - Plan for multiple cycles

5. **For expanding scope**: Ask permission, don't take. Frame it as helping others scale themselves.

6. **For ramping in new domains**: Talk to everyone, ask dumb questions early, get hands dirty with code even outside your area, and pick a hard problem to learn through.

7. **For career networking**: Never apply on websites—always reach out to someone you know. Build trust relationships without expecting immediate returns.
