## Summary

This episode of 20VC features Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O'Driscoll discussing major tech and venture capital news from the week. The conversation covers the shocking departure of Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross from their $1.1B venture fund to join Meta, Coreweave's strategic acquisitions, the PE and venture capital funding landscape, talent wars in AI, and broader economic predictions. The hosts analyze these events through the lens of market dynamics, founder incentives, and the existential nature of AI competition.

## Key Insights

### Nat Friedman & Daniel Gross Leaving NFDG for Meta
- Built a $1.1B fund, 4x'd it in two years, with ~50% deployed (~$500M)
- Already up approximately $300M in carry in just two years
- Meta is purchasing 49% of the fund, allowing LPs to take money off the table (effectively guaranteeing a 2x return even if remaining investments fail)
- The deal structure: each LP can choose how much to sell (up to 49%), then it aggregates
- The hosts estimate they walked away from potentially $800M-$1B in future value (the undeployed capital plus Fund 2 they were about to raise)
- Jason predicted this outcome when competing against them on a deal - recognized they were builders, not career VCs
- Comparison to Gary Tan leaving Initialize to run YC (also left LPs with strong returns)

### Meta's Talent Accumulation Strategy
- Running an "Elon X playbook" of being aggressive and creating a mega-mecca for talent
- The best only want to work for the best - struggling unicorns can't attract great talent
- Key question: Will being the 4th or 5th broadly capable LLM be a compelling business for Meta?
- They feel "existential need to play" in AI regardless

### AI Talent Wars
- A multi-billion dollar company founder told Jason they have to give 0.5-1% of the company to each AI engineer now
- Cursor paying "insane amounts" for talent, creating pressure across the ecosystem
- Will be "the biggest issue of 2026 in B2B AI" - inability to recruit talent
- If a startup says they want to "hire a VP of AI," Jason says "sell all my shares" - that's not the answer
- Stock-based compensation at OpenAI exceeded revenue (119% of GAP revenue last year)

### Coreweave Acquisitions
- Bought Core Scientific for $9B and Weights & Biases for $1B
- Strategic use of highly-priced stock to deleverage the business
- Replacing fixed costs (rent/leases) with equity - smart de-risking
- Went from "100% leveraged on infinite data center demand to 80% leveraged"
- Rory suggests there's a plausible scenario where data center demand slows in 3-4 years

### Venture Capital Market Dynamics
- VC deals at 8-year low according to Carta data
- "Flight to consensus" or "flight to quality" - small number of things working really well
- Attention begets more attention in early AI markets - if you pull ahead, hard to catch up
- Triple-triple-double-double growth is now "boring" compared to AI moonshots
- Investors want to "swing harder for the fences" - either it's off to the races or they pass
- Companies not in the AI wave will trade at discounted valuations

### Private Equity & Capital Markets
- Tom Bravo bought Olo for $2B (320M ARR, GAAP profitable) - 6x ARR
- A "meat and potatoes" deal - 20% grower, profitable, defensible vertical SaaS
- Won't save 500-700 unicorns single-handedly
- Vanguard adding PE exposure to target date funds - hosts skeptical about retail investors in PE
- QSBs (Qualified Small Business Stock) exemption increased from $10M to $15M in new tax bill

### University Endowments Under Pressure
- Stanford doing layoffs, Harvard facing $1B funding gap
- Federal research funding cuts and potential endowment tax increases
- Wrong people getting punished - humanities protesters cause problems, cancer researchers get cut
- Will be less active as a source of venture capital

### Microsoft Layoffs & Sales Evolution
- Laid off 9,000, replacing general salespeople with solutions engineers
- Clay and Palantir following similar models (forward-deployed engineers vs. traditional sales)
- AI has "raised the bar for customer expectations"
- 30-40% of one-to-two call sales reps will be replaced by AI
- Enterprise sales less affected, but even there, product knowledge trumps relationship skills

### Canva's AI Discovery Week
- Released all 5,000 employees from normal work for a week to learn AI
- Response to employees saying they're "too busy" to learn AI tools
- Harry's harsh take: if you need a discovery week for AI, you're not curious enough for the job
- Jason sees it as "notice" to employees about expectations
- 20VC approach: Friday 4-5pm everyone tries new tools, 5-6pm show and tell

## Main Arguments or Thesis

1. **Talent is the ultimate currency in AI**: The most capable builders will gravitate to where they can have maximum impact, whether that's founding companies, joining hyperscalers, or building products. Venture capital, while lucrative, isn't the highest and best use for generational builders.

2. **Market dynamics favor concentration**: In AI, early leaders compound their advantages through the attention-talent-execution flywheel. This creates a winner-take-most dynamic that makes catch-up nearly impossible.

3. **Existential threats demand existential responses**: When companies like Meta decide AI is existential, they'll spend whatever it takes. As Rory notes, "No one ever said to Winston Churchill, 'Did you bring World War II in on budget?' They just said, 'Did you win World War II?'"

4. **Dilution concerns are context-dependent**: Early-stage and loss-making companies should focus on building value rather than optimizing for dilution. Only profitable companies should truly agonize over SBC and equity issuance.

## Notable Quotes or Highlights

**Rory O'Driscoll on existential competition:**
> "No one ever said to Winston Churchill, 'Did you bring World War II in on budget?' They just said, 'Did you win World War II?' The truth is this, when it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win."

**Jason Lemkin on AI talent:**
> "If a startup says 'I want to hire a VP of AI,' I'd like to sell all my shares on any secondary market that exists. If you think your answer is to go hire a VP of AI that wears a tie and is studying things, just shut the startup down."

**Rory on talent attraction:**
> "The best only want to work for the best. They won't tolerate anything else. That's why so many struggling unicorns are in an existential death spiral because they can't attract anyone great."

**Jason on venture economics:**
> "The only value I think you can add in venture in the world really is if you discover talent that would otherwise not get funded. Like that's the mitzvah in it."

**Harry on employees not embracing AI:**
> "If you don't want to embrace it, you are going to make this ship sink... You've got to be curious yourself."

**Rory on market concentration:**
> "If you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it's very hard to catch up... the sad truth is no one wants nearly as good."

## Practical Takeaways

1. **For founders**: Recognize that differentiation matters more than ever. Triple-triple-double-double isn't enough - you need durable competitive advantages that can win in your segment.

2. **For employees**: Proactively learn AI tools - don't wait for company-mandated training. Continuous learning (like 20VC's Friday tool exploration) beats one-time discovery weeks.

3. **For investors**: Consider whether companies are positioned for AI-era talent competition. Stock-based compensation will be highly dilutive but may be necessary for survival.

4. **For LPs**: Be prepared for increased GP mobility. Strong founders and builders may not stick with venture for 20 years - evaluate whether fund structures protect you in transition scenarios.

5. **For sales professionals**: Relationship selling alone won't survive. Product knowledge and solutions engineering capabilities are becoming table stakes.

## Additional Context

- The hosts regularly disagree respectfully, with Jason taking contrarian positions (e.g., betting Shaun Maguire leaves Sequoia, betting against recession)
- Kashi (prediction market) prices are discussed for several scenarios including recession probability and executive departures
- The conversation reflects post-2021 venture market dynamics where many funds have portfolios of $100-200M ARR companies growing only 10-30%, requiring constant attention
- QSBs tax benefits allow up to $15M in federal tax-free gains on startup investments (stackable with trusts to potentially $50M+)
