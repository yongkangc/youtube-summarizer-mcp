## Summary

This is an in-depth conversation with Toby Lütke, founder and CEO of Shopify, covering his philosophy on company building, product development, and entrepreneurship. Toby shares how he fundamentally reimagined Shopify's operating model during COVID-19 by replacing traditional executives with founder-operators, implementing engineering principles to company structure, and rejecting Silicon Valley orthodoxy. He discusses his belief that companies are social technologies that enable people to pursue ideas full-time, the importance of differentiation over mimicry, and how he approaches everything from compensation systems to office design through first principles thinking. The conversation reveals Toby's contrarian approach to running a $200+ billion company, including going public early, embracing constraints, and treating company building as an engineering problem to be solved iteratively.

## Key Insights

- **Companies as social technology**: Companies are institutions that make it socially acceptable to spend 14+ hours per day pursuing ideas. They're a relatively recent invention (500 years old in modern form) that allow people to work on counterfactuals to the existing world and get market feedback
- **Modern companies are still terrible**: Despite running a $200B+ company, Toby believes all companies today are poorly built. In 20 years, we'll look back embarrassed at current practices, similar to looking at your first podcast episode
- **The COVID pivot saved Shopify**: During COVID, Toby reviewed every single project in the company (taking 16-hour days), canceled 60% of them, and turned over his entire executive team within a year. This forced reckoning revealed widespread "boondoggles" and misalignment
- **Trust falling vs. active leadership**: Before COVID, Toby was "cosplaying" as a traditional CEO, trust-falling and letting teams self-direct. He learned that executives were directing his attention only to projects they wanted him to see, while telling teams what he supposedly wanted based on limited context
- **Founders perform differently in crisis**: During COVID, Toby discovered it was almost impossible to predict who would rise to the occasion. People he expected to excel didn't, and vice versa. The unifying factor: founders of acquired companies consistently performed because they'd been responsible for people's livelihoods
- **The founder channel**: Toby maintains a Slack channel with founders of companies Shopify acquired. During COVID, when struggling, he turned to them for help and ultimately promoted many to executive roles, including taking individual contributors and putting them in charge of large organizations
- **Irritants are valuable**: Founders don't settle. They talk in absolutes. When something is broken, they say so, even if everyone else has agreed to move on. Companies naturally try to isolate these people (like "skunk works" teams), but Toby deliberately put them in leadership
- **Shopify OS - engineering a company**: Toby built a Python-based "desire state system" that models the entire company structure - departments, levels, titles, reporting relationships. It revealed 8,000 people had 5,500 different titles, with inconsistent hierarchies across teams
- **Desire state systems eliminate politics**: When the head of sales requests 50 people, the system automatically shows the tradeoffs - which engineering roles would be lost or what other changes are required. No more backroom deals or vague promises
- **The mastery system**: Shopify extended the engineering concept of individual contributor tracks to all disciplines. You can make as much money and advance as far as a "master" in your craft as you could as a VP, removing the pressure to become a manager
- **Compensation with agency**: After the stock dropped 80%, Toby rebuilt the compensation system so employees choose quarterly how to split their compensation between cash, stock options, RSUs, and "shop cash." They can even lock in stock value for 3 years. This gives employees agency instead of being passive recipients
- **Differentiation even if it's worse**: Toby agrees with James Dyson's principle - make it different even if it's worse initially. Copying creates 7/10 solutions with no mastery. Building from first principles might create a 6/10, but you can iterate to 11/10 because you understand it deeply
- **The SpaceX Raptor evolution**: Toby considers the visual evolution of SpaceX's Raptor rocket engine the most inspiring image in existence - showing how subtraction and iteration create masterpieces through team effort
- **Companies reject excellence by addition**: Very few teams can move forward by subtraction. Most companies accumulate complexity, while true progress comes from removing unnecessary elements
- **Five words change everything**: Toby's co-founder Daniel taught him that adding "for example" before giving feedback transforms defensiveness into collaboration. Small framing changes have massive effects
- **Silicon Valley distance advantage**: Starting in Ottawa meant Toby got aspirational advice from Valley founders (their highlight reel), not the messy reality. This accidentally helped - he was comparing Shopify's average to everyone else's aspirations
- **Translation forces innovation**: Having to translate ideas from Silicon Valley to Ottawa forced Toby to localize and improve them rather than copy directly. Ignorance became a competitive advantage
- **Going public was contrarian**: When Shopify IPO'd in 2015 at $1-1.5B valuation with 800 people, everyone said stay private longer. Toby saw this as an unforced error - public markets need growth, and accredited investor laws just concentrate returns among the wealthy
- **The IPO as differentiation**: Shopify made a documentary-style roadshow video instead of a CEO with a camcorder. They looked for every opportunity within SEC constraints to do things differently. It became a major conversation piece
- **Stock price is just betting**: When Shopify dropped 80%, Toby felt relieved because the 50x revenue valuation was unsustainable. He focused on fundamentals, viewing the public market as a betting market separate from the real business value
- **The Formula 1 mindset**: Formula 1 teams read the rulebook to beat it, not comply with it. Toby applies this to every constraint, from SEC regulations to internal policies - finding creative solutions within the rules
- **Public company as public Shopify**: Their motto was "we are not going public, we are creating a public version of Shopify." They refused to become a different company just because they had public shareholders
- **Books are life cheat codes**: Reading biographies gives access to entire careers in hours. Toby has read 410+ founder biographies and believes if you don't read books you live one lifetime, if you do you live thousands
- **Business books are mostly useless**: Written by people who have time to write (not people building companies), business books tend to reflect the author's bias - if they're a salesperson, every problem is solved by sales
- **Nostalgia is dangerous**: Nostalgia used to be listed on death certificates in the 1800s. Overcoming sunk cost fallacy is essential, and nostalgia prevents moving forward
- **The corporate raider exercise**: Toby regularly imagines he's a corporate raider who bought bankrupt Shopify and is marching in on day one to turn it around. This mental model helps overcome attachment to past decisions
- **Writing hit pieces on yourself**: Toby literally writes critical assessments of past work to overcome pride and identify improvement areas. This affirmation technique rewrites neural pathways
- **Affirmations actually work**: Despite being logical/analytical, Toby uses affirmations extensively. He overcame his fear of public speaking by writing "I love public speaking" for 10 minutes daily for a week
- **Messages in a bottle**: Toby writes scheduled messages to his future self about insights, process improvements, and topics to revisit, giving himself space for repetition and reflection
- **The brain is a narrative alignment mechanism**: The brain isn't good at record-keeping; it reconciles history with your current identity. You can exploit this by changing your identity through affirmations
- **Context podcast**: Toby runs an internal Shopify podcast called "Context" exploring decision-making processes. Initially limited to 23-minute episodes (average employee commute time), now unlimited length
- **Engineering immaturity**: Software engineering is an immature discipline compared to electrical engineering. Zero marginal cost of copying means bad decisions have externalities (like pollution) that don't accrue back to engineers who caused them
- **Environmental design matters**: Daniel (co-founder) realized "no one can be more creative than the space around them." Toby gave him a budget to create 10/10 spaces inexpensively
- **The five-person pod**: Shopify's offices feature "pods" sized for exactly 5 people (the optimal team size). Put 7 people in and it's uncomfortable. This eliminates the need for policies about team size
- **Norman doors are unacceptable**: Toby is "fundamentally allergic" to Norman doors (doors with misleading affordances). They represent fundamental design failures and were immediately replaced in Shopify offices
- **Product is just details**: From the inside, product doesn't exist as an abstraction - it's millions of details. The way you do anything is how you do everything, down to door handles and acoustic dampening
- **100% Shopify sourcing**: Everything in Shopify offices comes from Shopify stores. If something they need doesn't exist on the platform, they help someone start that business
- **Enterprise sales for floorboards**: Shopify once required a supplier to migrate to their platform before they could buy the company's floorboards for their office
- **Be worthy of talent**: Toby's job isn't to recruit better people - it's to build a company worthy of the best talent. Most companies skip this step and just try to improve their recruiting team
- **Geographic consensus**: Toby knew he could create consensus in Eastern Canada that Shopify was the best company to work for. In Silicon Valley, he couldn't compete with Google's compensation
- **Entrepreneurship as product**: Toby sees everyone as an entrepreneur of their own capabilities. Your product is your work output, your market is available companies, and employment is an exclusive subscription
- **Hire for spikes**: Shopify looks for spiky, non-conformist talent rather than well-rounded people. They review life stories looking for high-agency responses to adversity
- **Most founders are entrepreneurs**: Many Shopify employees started Shopify stores, built businesses, fell in love with the company, and applied for jobs. This entrepreneurial background is highly valued
- **Work is a two-sided opt-in**: Employment is a mutual relationship. "Be too good to ignore" is Toby's advice for increasing compensation - demonstrate the value you're adding
- **Mission-driven over compensation-optimized**: Shopify never tries to be the highest compensation play. People who optimize purely for money don't succeed there because it's mission-driven
- **Compound career returns**: Toby promises faster skill development at Shopify than anywhere else, leading to higher long-term compensation through accelerated capability building
- **Prototyping to building phases**: Projects start in a prototype phase (explore the problem), then transition through a review meeting (with AI preview capability) to a build phase with full autonomy
- **Trading accountability for autonomy**: Once a project transitions to build phase, Toby assumes the risk. This trade gives teams autonomy while removing personal risk
- **Phase transitions, not continuous management**: Clear phase gates (prototype, build, release) with reviews at transitions, rather than continuous oversight
- **AI can preview your review**: Toby trained an AI on all his past reviews so teams can preview what he'll likely say before the actual meeting, saving time and improving preparation
- **Boxes for creativity**: Define the problem space (the "box"), provide the right team and tools, then let them explore. The best solutions come from autonomy within clear boundaries
- **Starcraft as business training**: Toby credits Starcraft with teaching him resource management, imperfect information decision-making, and that attacking attention is more valuable than attacking resources
- **Attention is a resource**: In Starcraft and business, managing attention (yours and competitors') is often more important than managing quantifiable resources
- **Skill-based matchmaking for progress**: Starcraft's ELO system gave clear feedback on absolute skill level. Winning more = progressing, losing more = regressing compared to all other players
- **AI agents are like Starcraft**: Working with multiple AI agents coordinating (they email each other) while managing attention across them mirrors Starcraft gameplay exactly
- **Year 21 will be hardest and most interesting**: Despite 21 years of challenges, Toby believes 2025-2026 will be both the hardest and most interesting period in Shopify's history due to AI transformation
- **Progress every 3 weeks**: The world is changing so rapidly that conversations from just 3 weeks ago are already outdated. New AI capabilities emerge constantly
- **Stable times need different leaders**: Toby admits if times were stable, there would be better leaders for Shopify. He excels in times of rapid change and disruption
- **Personal mission since 2014**: Toby's mission is to "cause more entrepreneurship" - helping the maximum number of people discover and pursue entrepreneurship
- **Engineering is really building**: Toby realized he loved engineering because it was how he built things as a kid. He actually loves building - first products, then companies that create products
- **Information gap is the problem**: 80% of Shopify customers have someone who will respond to entrepreneurial questions within 24 hours. That's not representative - it's why they became customers in the first place
- **Survivorship bias in entrepreneurship**: People who don't know entrepreneurship exists, or have no exposure to it, simply won't try. It's not part of their toolbox
- **AI democratizes making**: Just-in-time manufacturing, 3D printing, humanoid robotics, and AI will make creating products much more accessible to everyone
- **The same project**: Toby sees his work (building tools for entrepreneurs) and this podcast (exposing people to entrepreneurial stories) as working on the same mission from different angles
- **Decision-making across layers**: Good executives meet teams at their level and help them understand how their work connects to larger frames of reference and ultimately the mission
- **Everything connects to mission**: Everyone should be able to connect their daily work to the mission. Customer support isn't just helping people - it's helping people not give up on being entrepreneurs
- **Four or five different frames**: Problems need to be evaluated at multiple abstraction levels - what's optimal at one level may be completely wrong at a higher level of analysis
- **Contradictions across frames**: The same person can hold apparently contradictory views because optimal solutions differ dramatically depending on the frame of reference (tactical vs strategic vs existential)
- **Quantifiable at the bottom, bets at the top**: At infrastructure levels, measure everything. At strategic levels about market entry and AI trends, you must work with trend lines and make bets
- **Reflexively try AI first**: Toby issued a memo making it a company expectation to reflexively try AI tools first when solving problems. Initially controversial, now obviously correct
- **Three months changes everything**: What seems ridiculous about AI adoption today will seem obvious in three months. The memo that drew pushback now seems like stating the obvious
- **Fight for the interesting**: Toby loves the current moment because it's both hard and interesting - his favorite combination and what he feels he's built for
- **Be likable, don't make people like you**: Your job is to make yourself worthy of being liked. If someone dislikes you after that, it's their category mistake, not your problem
- **Taste and quality can't be quantified**: The things most important for building great companies are the things that can't be written down as lists or reduced to numbers
- **Lists attract the wrong people**: Writing down what you look for in hiring attracts people good at following lists, not the people you originally hired who didn't need lists
- **Performative vs. intrinsic**: Systematizing processes creates ways for people to performatively do what you want without intrinsically being that way
- **Actively avoid writing things down**: Sometimes the most important thing you can do is deliberately not document something to prevent performative compliance
- **Change opinions with better information**: The cheat code to always being right is updating your opinion every time you get better information, so you have the best view when decisions must be made
- **Momentarily steer to best outcome**: At any moment you have one chance to steer toward the best possible outcome - prioritize being good over looking consistent
- **Plan B is often better**: For most people, consistently doing their "plan B" would lead to better outcomes than their plan A. Plan B gets the ambitious option
- **Humans come with sunk cost fallacy**: It's built into our firmware. You must consciously operate it out of yourself or you'll chase bad with good money and time
- **Fear of change > misery**: Humans reflexively fear change more than they hate their current situation, even if miserable. This keeps people in boring or bad environments
- **Intelligent actors in local incentives**: Never begrudge anyone for being an intelligent actor in the local incentive system. If someone exploits the system, that's your fault for designing it badly
- **Incentive design is your skill issue**: If the incentive system tells people to behave contrary to company goals, that's not their fault for following incentives - it's your failure as a designer
- **Collaborative project, not ownership**: Once work is contributed to the company commons (PR accepted, phase transition approved), it's no longer yours - it's the company's to improve
- **Stewardship not ownership**: Shopify only allows "stewardship" terminology for code areas, never "ownership." It's more like an open source project or Wikipedia - collaborative, not possessive
- **Talk trash to energize change**: Toby deliberately criticizes current systems (including his own past work) to create energy for improvement and prevent respect for status quo from blocking progress
- **Proper framing is everything**: The difference between defensive resistance and energized collaboration is often just "five words" of framing at the start of a conversation
- **Unpopular when done wrong**: Trash-talking current systems is unpopular if people aren't in the right headspace, incredibly effective if they are. The difference is usually just framing
- **Coffee areas create serendipity**: Placing coffee stations on opposite sides of floor from workstations forces people to traverse, creating unexpected encounters
- **Stairs between floors**: Cutting through floors to add stairs between teams ensures people encounter users of the infrastructure they build
- **Window seats for workers**: Meeting rooms go in the middle (less desirable space) because people shouldn't spend all day in meetings. Work pods get natural light
- **Floor plan mistakes through mimicry**: Toronto office has flaws that clearly mimicked Daniel's ideas without understanding them - pods too big, meeting rooms with best views
- **Open source floor plans**: Shopify open-sourced their office designs, but many companies cargo-culted the appearance without understanding the principles
- **Sound dampening innovation**: Shopify worked with companies on their platform to create acoustic dampening products now used industry-wide
- **Hallway discomfort is intentional**: Hallways are deliberately echoey so talking there feels uncomfortable, encouraging people to move to proper spaces
- **Meeting rooms acoustically treated**: Immediate noticeable difference entering meeting rooms due to sound diffusion - enables better conversation
- **No debt, German mindset**: Toby is German and doesn't take on debt. When stock dropped 80%, he wasn't worried because he had enough cash and no debt obligations
- **Relieved by stock drop**: Toby felt relief when stock dropped 80% because trading at 50x revenue was unsustainable and created unrealistic pressure
- **Short-term voting, long-term weighing**: Stock market is a voting machine short-term, weighing machine long-term (Buffett). Just build a "heavy" company with strong fundamentals
- **Stock options underwater problem**: After 80% drop, options were underwater. Employees felt the company owed them because they were passive recipients with no agency
- **Agency solves resentment**: Giving employees quarterly choice over compensation mix (cash/stock/RSUs) restored agency and eliminated resentment about stock price
- **Toolmaker identity**: Toby sees himself as a toolmaker above all else. His entire life is making tools, often for toolmakers. His pro chair is a tool he made
- **Craft for outcomes**: Appreciating craft is pragmatically excellent for getting good at pruning. Everything is about outcomes, but craft appreciation leads there
- **Stoic separation of control**: Toby applies Stoic philosophy about separating what's under your control from what isn't. Focus entirely on what you can influence
- **Internal locus of identity**: Don't make yourself likable to specific people (not your job). Make yourself worthy of being liked (your job). If they dislike you after that, their problem
- **High 70s have mentors**: Almost 80% of Shopify customers have someone they can email with entrepreneurial questions who responds in 24 hours
- **Causation not correlation**: Initially Toby thought it was cool so many entrepreneurs had mentors. Then realized causation reversed - they're customers because they had mentors
- **Exposure gap is massive**: Most people have no exposure to entrepreneurship through family or friends. They literally don't know it's an option or what they'd be signing up for
- **Podcasts fill the gap**: Biography podcasts and content expose people to entrepreneurship who otherwise would never encounter it, adding it to their toolbox
- **AI enables more making**: Combination of AI, just-in-time manufacturing, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, humanoid robotics means many more people will be able to make physical products
- **Capitalism's best parts**: Designing better products, eliminating Norman doors, creating superior tools - this is the beautiful side of capitalism that AI will make more accessible
- **Working on the same project**: Toby explicitly sees his work (building tools for entrepreneurs) and this podcast (sharing founder stories) as collaborating on the same mission

## Main Arguments or Thesis

**Core Thesis**: Building companies is an engineering problem that should be approached through first principles thinking rather than mimicking existing practices. Most companies are poorly designed due to path dependence and orthodoxy. The best approach is to make the company itself a technology - a deliberately engineered system that enables creative people to do their best work.

**Supporting Arguments**:

1. **Companies are technologies, not natural forms**: The modern company is only 500 years old and evolved from quasi-governmental entities. We shouldn't treat current practices as inevitable or optimal

2. **Differentiation demands new ideas**: You cannot build something better by copying what exists. Even if your different approach is initially worse, you have mastery over it and can iterate to excellence

3. **Context over credentials**: The person with the most context should make decisions, not the most senior person. This applies from code-level technical decisions to company-wide strategic choices

4. **Environment shapes behavior**: Rather than posting policies about how people should behave, design the environment so the correct behavior is intuitive and natural

5. **Founders have unique value**: People who have been responsible for others' livelihoods develop capabilities that can't be replicated through training. This changes you fundamentally

6. **Quantification kills excellence**: The things that matter most for great companies (taste, quality, craft) cannot be reduced to numbers or lists. Attempting to do so attracts performative compliance

7. **Agency over prescription**: Giving people agency (like choosing their own compensation mix) creates ownership and eliminates resentment better than any prescribed "fair" system

8. **AI accelerates everything**: The rate of change is now measured in weeks. Organizations and individuals that can't adapt this quickly will be left behind catastrophically

## Notable Quotes or Highlights

**On company building:**
- "Companies are social technology in the sense that they allow us to go all in. The only time you're really allowed to spend 14 hours a day singularly pursuing a thing is when you call it a company. It's socially acceptable."

- "We do not know how to build companies yet. All companies are terrible, including mine. In 20 years we're going to look back at what we were doing and be embarrassed."

- "Companies the concept is not that old. We're on a 500 year run. The modern company is really not that old. If you take that mindset that companies are just a path dependent solution to social and legal problems, you can figure out if your counterfactual might be correct."

**On the COVID transformation:**
- "It almost killed the company honestly. I had the inclinations that something was really going poorly. I went through every project, canceled 60% of them, and over the course of a year turned over every one of my executives."

- "In a real crisis, some people go to zero and some people go to 100. I found it's almost unpredictable. If I would have been betting before COVID about who would contribute most, I would have been entirely wrong."

- "People who have been responsible for people's livelihoods, that changes you."

**On founders:**
- "Founders don't settle. They talk about absolutes. If something is broken, they say so. It doesn't matter if everyone has agreed to move on. It gnaws at them in a way that's deeper."

- "I went to the founders channel and said guys, I need help. This place is crazy. I asked a lot of the founders to become my executives. Every one of those things worked."

**On decision-making:**
- "Making the right decision is actually child's play. The problem is people think there's one right answer. There's probably hundreds of great answers and one is far less work, far more modular."

- "The cheat code to always being right is just change your opinion every time you get better information. As you get closer to the decision point, you'll wind up with the right one."

- "Is your job to look good or be good? Change your mind when better information comes along."

**On differentiation:**
- "Make it different even if it's worse. You can make a 7/10 solution by copying what's out there. If you make from first principles your own version, even if it's a 6/10, you have mastery over it. You can iterate past the 7."

- "The SpaceX Raptor rocket evolution is the most inspiring picture that exists. That's today's Picasso. The great works are done by teams, and very few teams can move forward by subtraction."

**On office and environment design:**
- "No one can be more creative than the space around them and no one can care more than the person they work for."

- "I am fundamentally allergic to Norman doors. Create affordances that make people predictably do the wrong thing - that's a fundamental design error. Everyone involved should revoke their design license."

- "Product is not a thing. Product is an abstraction. From the inside, product is millions of little details. The way you do anything is how you do everything, down to floor plans and ambient noise."

**On talent and hiring:**
- "My job is not to recruit better people. It's to build a company worthy of the best talent. Most companies skip this step."

- "There are not that many good companies to work for. Not many companies deserve the attention of the most capable people."

- "We look for high agency experience. Something went wrong in your story - give me minute by minute how you reacted."

**On systems and incentives:**
- "Never begrudge anyone for being an intelligent actor in the local incentive system. If someone exploits your system, that's your skills issue in designing the incentive system."

- "If you need something and tell people what to do, you'll probably get it. If you don't tell them, you might get something you cannot possibly imagine if you have good people."

**On learning and progress:**
- "Books are the closest thing to cheat codes for real life. You can access the entire learnings of someone's career in a few hours. If you don't read books you live one lifetime, if you do you live thousands."

- "Affirmations work - the dumbest trick that works. I overcame my fear of public speaking by writing 'I love public speaking' for 10 minutes daily for a week."

- "The brain is a retrospective narrative alignment mechanism. It reconciles history with your current identity. You can change your identity, and affirmations literally rewrite your prefrontal cortex."

**On entrepreneurship:**
- "Entrepreneurship is glorious. People who reach for it do modern day heroics, go on a hero's journey with lots of naysayers, overcome incredible odds."

- "My entire life is founders. During the day I read biographies of founders - I've read 410 of them. At night I hang out with founders. I don't think I have a single friend that's not an entrepreneur."

- "My mission in life is to cause more entrepreneurship. I'll judge my career by: have I helped the maximum number of people do this thing I discovered was meaningful?"

**On current moment:**
- "Year 21 is going to be the hardest and most interesting year in Shopify's history, probably in everyone's career. Everything is lined up. Everyone will be measured by how well did you prepare, how quickly can you react, rearrive everything."

- "We're recording week 3 of 2026. If we recorded this in week 52 of 2025, it would be different. The world changes every 3 weeks right now."

- "Working with AI agents - I have six different agents going, coordinating between them, sending emails to each other. It's starting to look exactly like Starcraft."

**On philosophy:**
- "Focus on craft and giving a . It doesn't matter that a bunch of this stuff isn't quantifiable."

- "Your job is to make yourself worthy of being liked. If someone dislikes you after that, it's their category mistake."

- "Be easy on the path but the outcome should matter to you. Did you accomplish what you set out for in aggregate?"

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Use the corporate raider mental model**: Regularly imagine you're a hostile acquirer who bought your bankrupt company. What would you change on day one? This overcomes sunk cost fallacy

2. **Write hit pieces on your own work**: Literally document everything wrong with things you're proud of. This affirmation technique helps you overcome attachment to past decisions

3. **Add "for example" before feedback**: Five words at the start of feedback transforms defensive reaction into collaborative exploration. Frame suggestions as possibilities rather than corrections

4. **Implement desire state systems**: Model what your organization should look like as code/configuration, then use it to show tradeoffs. When sales wants 50 people, system shows what engineering roles you'd lose

5. **Create five-person teams**: Military and tech both converge on 5 as optimal team size. Design physical pods that fit 5 comfortably, 7 uncomfortably - eliminates need for team size policies

6. **Phase-based project structure**: Prototype phase (explore), transition review (with AI preview), build phase (full autonomy). Trade accountability for autonomy at phase transitions

7. **Give employees compensation agency**: Let people quarterly adjust their mix of cash/stock/RSUs. Eliminates resentment about stock price changes because they have control

8. **Design environment to make correct behavior intuitive**: Don't post policies about behavior. Make hallways echoey so talking there feels uncomfortable. Put coffee on opposite side from desks to create serendipity

9. **Hire for spiky high-agency**: Look for life stories showing entrepreneurial responses to adversity, not well-rounded credentials. Ask "something went wrong - give me minute by minute how you reacted"

10. **Extend mastery tracks to all disciplines**: Don't force people to become managers to advance. Let people progress in craft excellence with equivalent compensation to VP/leadership tracks

11. **Source everything from your customers**: Shopify sources 100% of office materials from Shopify stores. If something doesn't exist, help someone start that business

12. **Go public earlier than advice suggests**: Accredited investor laws concentrate returns among wealthy. Public markets need growth. Don't spend years figuring out how to stay private

13. **Read rulebooks to beat them**: Approach every constraint like Formula 1 engineers - find creative solutions within rules rather than just complying

14. **Use affirmations systematically**: Spend 10 minutes daily writing the identity you want (e.g., "I love public speaking"). It rewires your prefrontal cortex in about a week

15. **Schedule messages to future self**: Write yourself messages about insights, process improvements, topics to revisit. Give yourself space for repetition over time

16. **Reflexively try AI first**: Make it organizational expectation to attempt AI solution before reverting to traditional methods. What seems obvious today seemed crazy 3 months ago

17. **Create internal founder networks**: Maintain special channels/groups with founders of acquired companies or entrepreneurial employees. Turn to them in crisis

18. **Replace Norman doors immediately**: Any affordance that makes people predictably do the wrong thing should be fixed immediately. It represents fundamental design failure

19. **Connect all work to mission**: Everyone should be able to draw line from their daily tasks to company mission. Support isn't helping people - it's helping people not give up on entrepreneurship

20. **Meet teams at their abstraction level**: Good executives translate between frames of reference - helping tactical teams understand how their work connects to strategic goals

21. **Eliminate titles and level inconsistency**: Use software to model organization structure. Shopify had 5,500 titles for 8,000 people with inconsistent hierarchies across teams

22. **Make space for creative exploration**: Define the problem space (the "box"), equip the right team, then give full autonomy. Best solutions come from exploration, not prescription

23. **Separate quantifiable from bets**: At infrastructure level, measure everything. At strategic level (market entry, AI trends), work with trend lines and place informed bets

24. **Build company you'd want to work for**: Dystopian outcome is spending 10 years building another company you wouldn't want to work at. Why would you use your life for that?

25. **Geographic consensus strategy**: Instead of competing in saturated markets, create consensus in new geography that you're the best option. Toby couldn't beat Google pay in Valley but dominated Eastern Canada

- Building with AI now mirrors Starcraft gameplay - attention management across agents

**Cultural and philosophical foundations:**
- Stoicism heavily influences Toby's thinking (control what's under your control, focus on craft)
- Survivorship bias critical to understand - 80% of Shopify customers have entrepreneur mentors (correlation not causation)
- Information gap is real barrier to entrepreneurship for most people
- Brain's narrative alignment mechanism can be exploited through affirmations
- Nostalgia used to be on death certificates - it's dangerous to progress
- Plan B is often the better path people are afraid to take

**Future predictions:**
- AI plus just-in-time manufacturing, 3D printing, humanoid robotics will democratize making
- Many more people will realize they can be entrepreneurs with lower barriers
- Learning skills of designing better products (no Norman doors) will become more common
- Shopify and founder story podcasts working on same mission from different angles

**Personal details that inform philosophy:**
- Dyslexic (common among great founders)
- Started Shopify while living in wife's childhood bedroom at parents-in-law's house
- Father-in-law covered payroll at times
- Didn't take salary for four years
- Started in Ottawa Canada specifically to avoid Silicon Valley dynamics
- Daniel (co-founder) is childhood friend - polymath who learned programming when asked, won poker tournaments, became DJ
- Primary hobbies: motorsports (Formula 1 racing simulator), kiteboarding, tennis - all "easy to learn, hard to master"
- Has racing simulator setup where he listens to podcasts while practicing
- Reads 410+ founder biographies
- No friends who aren't entrepreneurs
- Still codes and makes first 20-30 commits in new repositories

This conversation reveals Toby as someone who treats company building as an engineering problem to be solved through first principles thinking, who values differentiation over conformity, who believes in giving agency rather than prescribing solutions, and who sees entrepreneurship as the path to self-actualization that should be made accessible to far more people.
