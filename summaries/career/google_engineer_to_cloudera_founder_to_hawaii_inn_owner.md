## Summary

This is a podcast interview with Kristoff Bashilia, who joined Google as employee ~800 before the IPO, helped pioneer cloud computing education, co-founded Cloudera (a company that commercialized Hadoop and reached a $4 billion valuation), and later transitioned from tech to hospitality by purchasing a unique off-grid bed and breakfast in Hawaii with a 120-foot private waterfall. The conversation covers his journey through Silicon Valley, the lessons learned from founding multiple startups, the painful realities of being a CEO including laying off 80% of a company, and his philosophical evolution toward finding work that he genuinely cares about rather than chasing pure financial returns.

## Key Insights

### Early Career at Google (2003-2008)
- Joined as one of the first engineers with only an undergraduate degree (Google primarily hired masters and PhDs)
- Got referred by professor Pedro Domingos after building a search engine as a senior project
- Witnessed company growth from 800 to 8,000 employees
- Transitioned from core engineering to becoming a public face for cloud computing concepts
- Pioneered Google's shuttle program migration that drew tech talent from Palo Alto to San Francisco

### The "Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission" Philosophy
- Used accumulated 20% time to teach a Hadoop class at University of Washington
- Created curriculum that was adopted by Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, and dozens of other schools
- Convinced Eric Schmidt to give him an entire data center (Atlanta facility being decommissioned)
- Partnered with IBM and National Science Foundation to demonstrate cloud computing applications beyond web companies

### Founding Cloudera
- Started the company while still technically employed at Google with Eric Schmidt's blessing ("Only if you want to ruin it" regarding talking to legal)
- Recruited experienced co-founder Mike Olsen (who had sold Sleepycat to Oracle) because Kristoff was 28 with no company-running experience
- Raised $5 million from Excel on "a glorified PowerPoint deck and an open source project"
- No actual product initially - just training, certification, and support services
- The distribution/packaging system that became their first product was an "accident" - created to make support easier

### Hard Lessons About Fundraising
- Raised too much money at too high valuations ($5M Series A, then $18M)
- "When you're building a company, you start out with all the power and control, and then you embark on a one-way street of giving up that power and control"
- VCs can "fix" high valuations later through deal structure; founders cannot
- Would have preferred raising less money to force more focus on product-market fit
- References the Silicon Valley TV show scene about raising less money

### The Reality of Being CEO
- "I don't think I'm a particularly great CEO"
- Strengths: vision, leadership, storytelling, organizational design, getting people to believe before there's rational reason
- Weaknesses: not super detail-oriented, operational management
- "I really liked the role that felt more like an uncle to the organization than a father. I liked being the cool uncle much more than I liked being the dad"

### Second Startup Failure and Painful Decisions
- Started company focused on personalization platform for big data applications
- Faced decision: take $10M venture debt or dramatically downsize
- Chose to lay off 80% of company (50 to 8 people) rather than "step on the gas in front of a brick wall"
- Describes the gut-wrenching experience of laying off 40 people he knew personally in one day
- Company eventually wound down when retail customers couldn't close deals before Black Friday, and investors refused to waive pro-rata rights for his personal bridge funding

### Transition to Hospitality
- Took a year off after second company, traveled, reflected
- Set criteria for next venture: legacy asset, creative outlet, semi-permanent community, good long-term investment
- Found 20-acre property with 120-foot private waterfall in Hawaii on Zillow
- Property is completely off-grid (hydroelectric, solar, wells, battery systems)
- "I wanted to put my effort into something that I gave a shit about"

### Current Philosophy on Work and Success
- Stays connected to tech as LP in venture funds rather than active operator
- Values being a "facilitator more than an operator"
- Can engage at whatever altitude he chooses and "duck out when it's not cool anymore"
- Still a workaholic - took sales calls during friend's visit to property

### The Math on Google Stock
- Original $30,000 options purchase would be 240,000 shares today
- If never sold, would be worth ~$72 million now
- "Definitely more than I've made taking the path I've made"

## Main Arguments or Thesis

1. **Execution trumps ideas**: "Any good idea, you should assume 10 other people already have." Success comes from surrounding yourself with smart people and executing well, not from having a unique idea.

2. **Raise less money, not more**: Counter-intuitively, taking less investment at lower valuations creates better focus and urgency around product-market fit. VCs can fix valuation mistakes; founders cannot easily fix loss of control.

3. **Corporate experience is valuable for entrepreneurs**: Rather than jumping straight into entrepreneurship, spend 1-2 years at a top company to build credibility, meet potential co-founders, and learn skills. "If you're 22, go get a corporate job at a company that's cool and then leave."

4. **Know your role**: Not everyone is suited to be a CEO. Understanding whether you're better as the "cool uncle" or the "dad" to an organization is crucial for finding the right position.

5. **AI changes job capabilities, not necessarily job counts**: AI makes individuals more productive (especially those with domain expertise who can evaluate outputs) but the concern is how junior engineers will develop into senior engineers if AI does entry-level work.

## Notable Quotes

- "When you're building a company, you start out with all the power and control, and then you embark on a one-way street of giving up that power and control."

- "The definition of insanity is to keep trying the same thing over and over again expecting different results."

- "I wanted to put my effort into something that I gave a shit about."

- "Entrepreneurship's either in your blood or it's not. And if it is in your blood, there's nothing that's going to stop you."

- "I really liked the role that felt more like an uncle to the organization than a father. I liked being the cool uncle much more than I liked being the dad."

- On NDAs: "No one signs NDAs and they don't really mean anything. They're barely worth the paper they're written on."

- On getting Eric Schmidt's approval to start a company while employed: "'Do I need to go talk with legal about that?' And he's like, 'Only if you want to ruin it.'"

## Practical Takeaways

1. **For aspiring entrepreneurs**:
   - Work at a respected company first to build credibility and network
   - Recruit experienced co-founders to complement your weaknesses
   - Raise only what you need to maintain focus and control
   - Be honest about whether you're suited for CEO role vs. other leadership positions

2. **For fundraising**:
   - Understand pro-rata rights and how they affect future rounds
   - Lower valuations can actually be advantageous long-term
   - VCs have mechanisms to fix their mistakes; founders don't

3. **For career transitions**:
   - Take time to reflect and set clear criteria before committing
   - Wealth enables optionality - use it to find genuinely meaningful work
   - Legacy assets can provide creative outlet without traditional employment structure

4. **For AI adoption**:
   - Domain expertise + AI tools = multiplicative productivity gains
   - Someone with CS background can "program again" by reviewing AI output
   - Current AI better augments experts than replaces them entirely

## Additional Context

- **Time period**: Kristoff's Google tenure was 2003-2008, Cloudera founding around 2008-2009, second startup in early 2010s
- **The Inn at Kulaniapia Falls**: Property at waterfall.net, featured on Netflix's "World's Most Amazing Vacation Rentals" in January 2020
- **Offer for viewers**: Book through waterfall.net, reply to confirmation mentioning "Scuba Steve" for $100 credit toward activities
- **Cloudera's fate**: Company still exists in different form; IPO was actually a down round from the $4B private valuation
- **Interview context**: Host Steve has known Kristoff for 25 years since college dorms; Kristoff was best man at employee's wedding
