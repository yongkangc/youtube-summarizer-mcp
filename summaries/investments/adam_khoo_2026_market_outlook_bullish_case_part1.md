## Summary
This video by Adam Khoo (Piranha Profits) discusses market outlook for 2026, recorded on December 27th with three trading days left in 2025. The presenter makes a bullish case for the US stock market in 2026, citing six key reasons including strong economic fundamentals, Fed rate cuts, expected 15% S&P 500 earnings growth, Trump administration's tax cuts and deregulation, favorable yield curve conditions, and technical uptrend patterns. He notes that 2025 marked the third consecutive year of double-digit gains for US markets (S&P up 17% YTD) despite persistent recession predictions from mainstream analysts. This is Part 1 of a two-part series, with Part 2 covering bearish arguments.

## Key Insights

### Market Performance Context
- S&P 500 up 17% year-to-date for 2025
- Third consecutive year of double-digit gains (2023, 2024, 2025)
- Adam Khoo's personal portfolio up 18.74% YTD, slightly beating S&P 500
- His students significantly outperformed him (31%, 32%, 127%, 28%, 208% gains mentioned)
- Khoo admits he was "too conservative" this year

### Historical Market Probability
- Over the last 74 years (1951-2024), the market ended positive 58 times (78% of years)
- Only 16 years ended with losses (21.6%)
- The baseline probability for any given year is 78% bullish
- The question for 2026: Is the probability above or below this 78% baseline?

### Six Bullish Arguments for 2026

**1. Strong US Economy**
- Q3 2024 GDP came in at 4.3% - best quarterly growth in two years
- Consumer spending was the key driver, up 3.5%
- Economy expected to grow 2.3-3% in 2026
- Lag effect of rate cuts will filter through the economy in 2026
- Fiscal stimulus from Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill"
- Fed in accommodative cycle (cutting rates, not raising)

**2. Federal Reserve Policy is Supportive**
- Fed in rate-cutting cycle, reduced fed funds rate from above 5% to 3.5-3.75%
- Fed expects one more cut in 2026 and one in 2027, targeting 3% neutral rate
- 3% is historically the "sweet spot" - middle of the range
- Quantitative Tightening (QT) ended in December 2024
- Increased money supply historically bullish for stocks
- When Fed cuts rates near all-time highs with no recession, market was up 12 months later in 22 out of 22 instances since 1980 (median gain: 11.1%)

**3. S&P 500 Earnings Growth**
- 15% earnings growth projected for calendar year 2026
- Magnificent 7 companies expected to report 22.7% earnings growth
- Other 493 S&P companies expected to grow 12.5%
- Growth driven by AI adoption, productivity gains, and automation
- Share price follows earnings

**4. Trump Administration Policies**
- "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes:
  - Deregulation and cutting red tape
  - Easier mergers and acquisitions
  - $137 billion in corporate tax cuts going to companies
  - $100 billion in household tax breaks
- More profits for companies = higher stock prices
- More money for consumers = more spending = higher GDP

**5. Yield Curve in Sweet Spot**
- Yield curve now upward sloping (previously inverted for years)
- 10-year Treasury yield at just below 4.2%
- Historical PE ratios highest when 10-year yield between 3.5-5.5%
- Currently within that "Goldilocks" zone
- As long as 10-year stays between 3.5-5.5%, favorable for equities

**6. Technical/Trend Analysis**
- Market on clear uptrend
- Fourth year of bull market (started October 2022)
- Fourth year of bull markets historically up 85.7% of the time (vs 78% normal)
- Moving averages aligned bullishly: 20 EMA > 40 EMA, 50 MA > 150 MA, 200 MA sloping up
- Price action showing higher highs and higher lows

### Criticism of Mainstream Predictions
- "Prophets of doom" have been wrong repeatedly
- June 2024: Experts predicted stock market crash in 2025 - didn't happen
- April 2025: Majority of economists predicted recession after Trump's tariff crash - didn't happen
- HSBC called it a "classic bear market rally" - wrong
- Jefferies cut S&P 500 target, predicted stocks would fall - wrong
- Wall Street trading desks said selloff "will get worse" in April - wrong
- Recession predictions have been made for the last 3 years consecutively - never materialized

## Main Arguments or Thesis

**Primary Claim**: 2026 is likely to be a bullish year for US equities, with odds above the historical 78% baseline, though the presenter expects single-digit rather than double-digit gains.

**Supporting Evidence**:
1. Historical data showing Fed rate cuts near all-time highs have always led to positive 12-month returns
2. End of QT combined with rate cuts creates "two tailwinds" 
3. Strong fundamental backdrop (GDP growth, earnings growth)
4. Fiscal stimulus adding money to both corporate and consumer pockets
5. Technical indicators all aligned bullishly

**Key Caveat**: No one can predict markets with certainty - forecasts are "purely for entertainment." The presenter emphasizes his investment decisions don't change based on macro outlook; he continues buying undervalued companies and taking both bullish and bearish trades as opportunities arise.

## Notable Quotes or Highlights

> "Ignore all these opinions from other people. Just stick to great companies, stick to the market, stay invested, and you will do very very well."

> "Forecasts are purely for entertainment."

> "Even if I think that 2026 the market is going to be bearish, I will still buy companies if I think they're undervalued because in the long run they're going to grow in value."

> "The trend is your friend."

> "Do I want to jump in right now? Probably not... I like to wait for a wave down to dollar cost average into the market before the next wave up."

> Regarding his conservative approach: "I think this year I was too conservative... My students are kicking my ass this year."

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Stay invested** - Don't try to time the market based on doom predictions
2. **Focus on quality companies** - Particularly the Magnificent 7 which are expected to lead earnings growth
3. **Dollar cost average** - Wait for pullbacks ("wave down") rather than buying at peaks
4. **Ignore mainstream doom predictions** - They've been consistently wrong for years
5. **Follow the trend** - Use moving averages to confirm market direction
6. **Base case is bullish** - Any random year has 78% probability of gains; 2026 odds may be higher
7. **Expect single-digit gains** - Not another double-digit year despite bullish outlook
8. **Two tailwinds for 2026** - End of QT plus strong earnings growth
