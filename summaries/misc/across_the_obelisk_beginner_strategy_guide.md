## Summary
This is a comprehensive beginner-to-intermediate strategy guide for "Across the Obelisk," a deck-building roguelike game. The creator, who has over 1,300 hours of gameplay experience including completing challenge runs on the highest difficulty, covers essential topics including perk allocation, character role specialization, deck building principles, and team composition strategies. The guide focuses on Madness levels 0-3 but notes most advice applies to higher difficulties. The video demonstrates these concepts through a detailed walkthrough using the four starting characters (Magnus, Andren, Evelyn, and Reginald) from Act 1 through Act 4.

## Key Insights

### Foundational Tips
- **Use the retry button liberally** - Fights can and should be retried when heroes are too low or when you lose. Even experienced players lose fights regularly; there's often an optimal card sequence that takes multiple attempts to find
- **Prioritize eliminating enemies quickly** - Getting enemies off the field fast gives your team a significant advantage
- **Don't underestimate target-specific upgrades** - Cards that can target specific monsters are valuable; learning which monster to focus first is key
- **Speed ties matter** - Heroes beat monsters in speed ties; heroes with matching speed go front-to-back positioning order (same for monsters)

### Perk Allocation Philosophy
- **Starting energy is the most important perk** for all characters - it enables snowballing fights quickly
- **Specialize characters into roles**: tank, support, healer, and damage dealer
- **Prioritize charges over flat damage boosts** - Take chill charges over cold damage, sanctify over holy damage, etc. Charges scale damage faster and synergize with cards/items throughout the game
- **Tanks should invest in**: block charges and resistances
- **Healers should invest in**: healing charges
- **Damage dealers should invest in**: damage type perks and associated charge perks

### Specific Character Perk Builds (33 points)
- **Magnus (Damage Dealer)**: Energy perks, 19 speed (for specific tie-breaking), slashing damage, bleed application, +1 vulnerable charges, "sharp on heroes increases slashing damage by 1.5x per charge"
- **Andren (Tank)**: Maximum speed investment (21 speed after gear), sharp charges, full block perks, mark charges, evasion charges; later swapped wet charges to thorns for 33% more Stone Skin effectiveness
- **Evelyn (Support/Secondary DPS)**: Max speed, fast charges (for Scroll of Speed synergy), cold damage focus, "wet charges also increase cold damage by 1 per charge"
- **Reginald (Healer)**: Max speed charges (needs Scroll of Speed to reach 19 speed), wet charges, regeneration, sanctify, "bless on heroes also increases holy resistance and doesn't lose charges at end of turn"

### Deck Building Principles
- **Maintain ~15 cards** - Add cards fitting your game plan while removing weaker ones
- **Match deck to energy curve** - With 4 starting energy and 3/turn, aim for ~75 total energy cost in a 15-card deck to play 5 cards per turn
- **Don't add too many copies of expensive cards** - Better to keep a thin deck that draws Firestorm often than have two Firestorms causing dead draws
- **End-game decks can be 18-23 cards** - Don't stress the 15-card limit, but monitor consistency
- **Replace defensive cards with offensive ones on damage dealers**

### Role-Specific Deck Building

**Damage Dealers (Magnus example)**:
- Replace defensive cards with offensive cards
- Include single-target damage (Bladestorm), cheap attacks for energy curve (Fast Strikes), AOE (Sweeping Strikes)
- Add scaling cards (Sharpen, Elvin Quiver item)
- Target-specific monster upgrades are valuable

**Tanks (Andren example)**:
- Caltrops for team-wide block
- Support cards like Chant of Accuracy (damage boost) and Chant of Initiative (speed control)
- Expert Tracker for Inspire generation
- Trace + Vigilance combo for card filtering and draw

**Healers (Reginald example)**:
- Can hybrid into damage/support
- Divine Power is "one of the most powerful support cards in the entire game" (gives Powerful, Bless, and Energize)
- Clarity for draw support
- Keep healing cards but make them cheaper
- Prophecy/Scry for digging to key cards

**Support (Evelyn example)**:
- Scrolls of Speed for team speed control
- Transmission for energy/draw to damage dealer
- Bookworm starts in opening hand - search for Scroll of Speed or Scroll of Intellect
- Can maintain frost damage as secondary role

### Combat Strategy Demonstrated
- **Turn order manipulation is crucial**: Andren (21 speed) → Evelyn (sped up) → Reginald (sped up to 19) → Magnus (19, but after Reginald due to position)
- **Support chain**: Andren gives speed/Expert Tracker to Evelyn → Evelyn gives speed/draw/energy to Reginald and Magnus → Reginald gives Divine Power/Bless/draw to Magnus → Magnus deals massive damage
- **Late game combo shown**: Magnus dealt hundreds of damage in near-one-turn wipes using Fury stacking, Whirlwind, Carnage chains, and support buffs

### Flexibility Notes
- **Any character can be a damage dealer** even on highest difficulty
- **Hybrid roles are viable** at Madness 14 and below
- **Full specialization handles more situations** but isn't required for lower difficulties
- **Play what's fun** - the game allows flexibility at lower Madness levels

## Main Arguments or Thesis

1. **Specialization beats generalization**: Characters should focus on one primary role (tank/support/healer/DPS) rather than splitting focus, though hybrid builds work on lower difficulties
2. **Resource efficiency wins games**: Starting energy perks, proper energy curves in decks, and maximizing card plays per turn compound into significant advantages
3. **Speed control is paramount**: Manipulating turn order through speed buffs allows your support chain to fully buff damage dealers before they act
4. **Charges > flat bonuses**: Investing in charge-related perks provides better scaling than flat damage increases
5. **Iteration is expected**: Using retry to find optimal play sequences is normal, not a crutch

## Notable Quotes or Highlights

- "Most runs I play now involve several losses. There is often an optimal way to play cards each fight and you will rarely do it right the first time."
- "Divine Power [is] one of the most powerful support cards in the entire game."
- "Going all in on one role will help you deal with more situations than splitting your focus."
- "At the end of the day this is a game - you should have fun with it and you can get away with a lot on lower Madness levels."
- "The most important cards to take are the ones that seem fun to you."
- On Ymir (Act 1 boss): "Ymir is a tree that doesn't bleed" - highlighting the importance of knowing boss mechanics

## Practical Takeaways

1. **For new players**: Use retry liberally, focus enemies down quickly, specialize your characters
2. **Perk priority**: Energy > Role-specific charges > Speed (for turn order) > Damage type bonuses
3. **Deck building**: Keep decks lean (~15 cards), match energy curve, replace weak cards rather than just adding good ones
4. **Team composition**: Decide on damage dealer first, build team support around them
5. **Speed setup example**: Tank at 21 → buffs Support to go next → Support buffs Healer to 19 → Healer (front position) buffs DPS at 19 → DPS acts last with all buffs
6. **Card selection**: Don't take duplicate expensive cards; thin deck > multiple copies
7. **You can change perks in the starting town** - useful for adjusting builds after seeing what cards you've acquired
