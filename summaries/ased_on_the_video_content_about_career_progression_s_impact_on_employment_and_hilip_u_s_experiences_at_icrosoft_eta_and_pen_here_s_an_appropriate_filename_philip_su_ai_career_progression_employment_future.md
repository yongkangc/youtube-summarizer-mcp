## Summary

This is an in-depth interview with Philip Su, a distinguished engineer who achieved rapid career advancement at Microsoft (8 promotions in 8 years) and Meta (reaching the rare E9 level), then voluntarily stepped down from E9 to E7 to work at OpenAI. The conversation explores career progression philosophy, the profound implications of AI on employment and society, engineering culture across major tech companies, financial advice for tech workers, and personal reflections on finding meaning in work. Philip presents a sobering yet nuanced view of AI's disruptive potential while advocating for thoughtful societal preparation and personal adaptation.

## Key Insights

### Career Progression Philosophy

- **The "Dog Chasing Car" Problem**: Speedrunning to your terminal level means exhausting your promotion runway early in your career, leaving decades without a sense of progress
- At Meta, going from E3 (entry level) to E9 (distinguished engineer) represents only 6 levels across a 45-year career - roughly one promotion every 7 years
- Getting to E6 within 3 years leaves only 3 promotions for the remaining 40+ years of your career
- The thrill is in the chase, not the destination - many people lack a plan for what comes after reaching their goal
- Philip experienced loss of purpose after achieving early promotions, realizing he hadn't considered the day-to-day reality of senior roles
- Annie Dillard quote: "How we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives" - emphasizes focusing on daily substance over titles
- The "ladder climbing" question: Are you climbing because you want the destination, or because the ladder was put in front of you?

### AI's Impact on Employment

- **Prediction skepticism**: Philip believes most expert predictions about which jobs are "safe" from AI are fundamentally misguided
- The historical chess-to-Go analogy: What seemed impossible (computers beating humans at Go) happened quickly despite expert consensus it wouldn't
- Current advice to pursue "hands-on" jobs like plumbing or machining may age as poorly as advice to become a Go champion would have in the 1990s
- Voice acting example: His friend, a professional voice actor for major games, will likely lose her job within years - representing displacement of people who love their work
- AI is more "discovery" than "invention" - even AI researchers are regularly surprised by model outputs, making predictions especially unreliable

### Labor Market Transformation

- **Head-tail dynamics**: Future will resemble NBA economics - top performers (top 1-10%) earn exponentially more, while others struggle
- OpenAI had ~120 developers when Philip joined, creating massive market value - suggesting extreme productivity concentration
- The "Spotify effect" on all professions: Just as top musicians now earn more than ever while mid-tier artists can't make a living, the same will happen across fields
- Companies will likely do "more with less" rather than "more with more" due to coordination costs (mythical man-month problem)
- Microsoft with 220K employees could potentially be more productive at 110K employees with AI augmentation, eliminating meeting overhead
- Small size becomes an advantage - barriers to entry collapse when three people in a garage can compete with large incumbents

### Speed of Displacement Crisis

- Unlike historical transitions (farmers to social media directors over generations), current displacement affects people mid-career
- 1910s America: 40% farmers → now 4%, but this happened generationally, not to individuals
- Current approach tells existing workers to completely retrain, not just their children to pursue different paths
- Social instability concerns due to rapid, within-lifetime disruption rather than multi-generational adaptation
- America is reactive rather than proactive with legislation - likely won't prepare adequate safety nets before major displacement

### Robot Ownership Economics

- **Critical framing**: "When you buy a robot that replaces you, you collect its paycheck. When your boss buys that robot, you get nothing."
- Same productivity outcome (one robot doing one person's work), completely different human outcomes
- Currently heading toward "boss buys the robot" model in every sector
- Amazon example: Replacing 500K of 1M workers with robots isn't inherently bad (the work is difficult), but leaving workers with no paycheck or share of robot productivity is problematic
- Need for societal debate about robot ownership and productivity distribution before displacement creates "revolution-level" unrest

### Bounty vs. Spread Framework

- AI will create unprecedented "bounty" (wealth, capability, solutions to global problems)
- Critical question is "spread" - will most of humanity benefit, or will three people own everything?
- Star Trek future (replicators, basic needs met, people express themselves freely) vs. Ready Player One dystopia (mass poverty, escapism, concentrated wealth)
- The technology itself is neutral; distribution mechanisms and policies determine outcomes
- Optimistic potential: curing cancer, alleviating global poverty, solving infrastructure problems, universal education access

### Education Revolution

- Philip's son used GPT throughout high school, gaining access to an "infinitely patient tutor"
- Transformative for children from under-resourced schools or single-parent homes where parents can't help with homework
- Teachers in low-funded schools often focus on behavioral management over content - AI tutors could fill this gap
- Free, high-quality education access could be democratizing force if properly distributed

### Capitalism Balance

- Rejects both extreme positions: "no billionaires" and unlimited wealth concentration
- Capitalism has empirically succeeded where socialist systems failed (China's success post-private ownership, immigration patterns)
- "Don't kill the golden goose" but also "don't dial it to 11 toward libertarianism"
- Need middle ground that doesn't hobble creative value creators but also doesn't allow 100% value capture
- The "he who does not work shall not eat" ethic only works if everyone willing to work *can* work for compensation

### Human Dignity and Work

- Moving story of grocery store employee with Down syndrome: society should value and include all people who want to contribute
- When AI surpasses all human capabilities, will we say "only elite intellects deserve to eat" or maintain inclusive participation?
- Philip employs Brazilian developer despite AI being more cost-effective because he values human collaboration and companionship
- Hope for "fair trade human" concept - willingly paying 15% more for human-made goods/services to value human dignity
- Different from wealthy people buying $4,000 Peruvian rugs as status symbols - should be about mutual appreciation and camaraderie

### Personal Innovation Dilemma

- Corporate innovator's dilemma applies to individuals: "disrupt yourself before the world disrupts you"
- People who "surf the tide" rather than fight it will survive
- Voice actor friend's tough choices: unionize (risky due to "three scabs blow it open" problem) or adapt
- Top 5% of voice actors might earn more than ever (like Scarlett Johansson licensing her voice); everyone else won't make a living
- Adaptation requires swimming faster as tide rises, not trying to stop the tide

### Software Engineering Specifics

- **Use AI or fall behind**: Philip will refuse to work for employers that don't allow AI use - opportunity cost too high
- Five years from now, developers without AI experience will be at severe disadvantage
- Currently hyperproductive with AI but job satisfaction lower - days spent reviewing AI's "subpar code" rather than crafting code
- Like becoming a "code review machine" rather than a craftsperson
- Coding without AI becomes like whittling - valuable for personal joy, not commercial viability
- The "human with AI beats AI alone" phase may be temporary - eventually AI will also master team leadership

### Career Advice for Developers

- If you can reach top 10%, you'll earn more than ever before
- If not in top 10%, deep thinking required: Can you live on less? Retrain into something else? Find specialization where you are top 10%?
- Working on "AI projects" at companies like Walmart likely not valuable - 90% are probably "crap" projects
- Essential to work for employers allowing AI tool use - refusing AI is career self-sabotage
- Embrace AI tools deeply or risk being disrupted by those who do

## Main Arguments or Thesis

**Primary Claims:**

1. **Career speedrunning is psychologically unsustainable**: Rapid early advancement exhausts promotion runway, creating decades without progress and purpose
2. **This time is different** with AI: Unlike previous technological disruptions, AI is general-purpose enough that retraining options will be limited for many people
3. **Winner-take-all economics will dominate**: Top performers across all fields will earn exponentially more while middle/lower performers struggle - not just in tech, but everywhere
4. **Companies will choose efficiency over growth**: Reduced headcount with AI augmentation will be more productive and profitable than expanding workforce
5. **Social instability is imminent**: America is unprepared for rapid, within-career displacement that will affect millions simultaneously
6. **Distribution, not capability, is the crisis**: AI will create unprecedented bounty, but current trajectory concentrates benefits rather than spreading them
7. **Human dignity requires work participation**: Society needs mechanisms for all willing workers to contribute meaningfully, even when they can't compete commercially with AI

**Supporting Evidence:**

- Mathematical career progression analysis (6 levels over 45 years)
- Historical technological surprise (Deep Blue → AlphaGo progression)
- Personal anecdotes (voice actor friend, Brazilian developer, grocery store employee)
- Economic comparisons (Spotify's effect on musicians, NBA salary dynamics, mythical man-month)
- Corporate experience insights from Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI
- AI research observation (researchers surprised by their own models)
- Coordination cost analysis (meeting overhead, communication burden)

**Counterarguments Addressed:**

- "This time isn't different" skepticism: Philip acknowledges he's making a prediction that has historically been wrong, but argues AI's general-purpose nature and researcher surprise indicate genuine novelty
- "Companies will do more with more": Addresses by explaining coordination costs make smaller teams more productive
- Economic efficiency vs. psychological needs: Admits to "irrational" decisions (paying off mortgage, keeping human employee) for valid psychological reasons
- Predictions are impossible: Embraces uncertainty but advocates for directional preparation and personal adaptability

- "The AI is about to make the bounty unbelievable. It's a question of spread: can we get the bounty in a way that most of humanity benefits?"
- "I'm frankly unsure our country has the wherewithal to put that together before massive displacement causes huge unrest, maybe even revolution."

## Practical Takeaways

**For Individual Career Management:**

1. **Don't speedrun thoughtlessly**: Consider whether you want to spend decades at your "terminal level" before racing to get there
2. **Plan beyond the promotion**: Before chasing advancement, understand the day-to-day reality of the role you're pursuing
3. **Embrace AI tools immediately**: Refusing to learn AI is career suicide; opportunity cost of not using AI is too high
4. **Aim for top 10% or specialize**: Middle-tier performance will be economically unsustainable across most fields
5. **Diversify skills**: Don't assume any single skill (even "hands-on" work) is permanently safe from automation
6. **Value daily substance over titles**: Focus on whether you enjoy the actual work, not just the prestige
7. **Prepare to adapt continuously**: "Disrupt yourself before the world disrupts you"

**For Financial Decisions:**

1. **Sell RSUs immediately**: If you wouldn't buy the stock today with cash, you shouldn't hold it (with psychological exceptions)
2. **Price in unrealized risk**: Surviving risk once doesn't make the risk-taking decision wise in retrospect
3. **Understand behavioral economics**: Acknowledge when you're making "irrational" decisions for valid psychological reasons
4. **Avoid survivorship bias**: Don't plan based on lottery winners (successful startups); most fail
5. **Consider living on less**: If not in top 10%, prepare for lower compensation future

**For Employers/Leaders:**

1. **Allow AI tool usage**: Organizations prohibiting AI will lose competitive talent
2. **Consider smaller teams**: Coordination costs mean smaller AI-augmented teams may outperform larger traditional teams
3. **Prepare for disruption**: Small competitors with AI can now challenge large incumbents
4. **Value human collaboration**: There are legitimate non-financial reasons to maintain human teams (camaraderie, brainstorming)

**For Society:**

1. **Debate robot ownership models**: Establish policies before mass displacement, not after
2. **Design proactive legislation**: America's reactive approach will be insufficient for AI disruption speed
3. **Focus on distribution mechanisms**: The bounty is coming; spreading it equitably is the challenge
4. **Preserve work dignity**: Create structures allowing all willing workers to participate meaningfully
5. **Prepare social safety nets**: Displacement will affect millions within single careers, not generations
6. **Balance capitalism**: Find middle ground between unlimited wealth concentration and innovation-killing constraints

**For Specific Professions:**

1. **Voice actors**: Unionization risky (easy to break); top 5% may thrive, others should prepare for career change
2. **Software developers**: Must use AI daily; job becomes more about review/leadership than crafting
3. **Physical labor**: Don't assume safety based on current LLM limitations; robotics advancing rapidly
4. **Creative fields**: AI can now handle "good enough" creative work for solo developers/small teams

## Additional Context

**Engineering Culture Comparisons:**

- **Early Facebook (500 engineers)**: "Move fast and break things" meant delivering value so fast that users tolerate bugs - not recklessness, but aggressive value prioritization
- **OpenAI**: Genuine mission-driven culture where most employees believed in positive human impact, not just compensation
- **Microsoft**: Heavy meeting culture (Philip worked there 12 years); interview process didn't leverage performance review history even for internal transfers
- **Company size impact**: Culture inevitably changes from 500 to 80,000+ employees; small company advantages include agility

**Personal Background Details:**

- Philip achieved 8 promotions in 8 years at Microsoft (had sleeping bag in office)
- Reached E9 (distinguished engineer) at Meta, then voluntarily moved to E7 at OpenAI
- Voluntarily demoted because he loved the work more than the title/scope
- Currently building Superic podcast app with Brazilian developer
- Rejected from jobs multiple times, even within companies he worked at
- Brother worked 27 years in Silicon Valley across 7 startups - zero successes, including "Silicon Valley's fastest market cap growing hardware startup of all time"

**Investment Philosophy:**

- Sold Meta RSUs early, missing millions in gains but stands by decision based on risk management
- Paid off mortgage at 3% interest despite financial suboptimality - acknowledges "irrational need" not to owe bank
- Most Facebook friends held stock longer and made significantly more money
- Congratulates them on fortune but not on "investing prowess"
- Warren Buffett considers his Omaha house (bought 1965 for ~$180K) his biggest financial mistake, yet still lives there

**On Coding with AI:**

- "Hyperproductive" with AI but job satisfaction lower
- Day spent reviewing AI's subpar code rather than crafting
- Turned himself into "code review machine"
- Coding for joy (like whittling) is valid but not commercially viable
- Swarm coding/agent management is current mode, but AI will eventually master team leadership too
- Still hasn't seen LLM tell a genuinely funny joke - sees humor as high bar requiring sophisticated theory of mind

**Superic Podcast App:**

- Built because existing players (Apple Podcasts, Spotify) capture 75% of market but #3 player is only 3%
- Evidence that dominant players "all suck" when #3 should be 12-14% in normal market
- Features missing from existing players: topic subscription (not just feed), real-time reactions, social features
- Built primarily for personal use, then released

**Caveats and Nuances:**

- Philip emphasizes uncertainty: nobody can reliably predict which jobs are safe
- Acknowledges saying "this time is different" has historically been wrong
- Recognizes both optimistic (Star Trek) and pessimistic (Ready Player One) futures are possible
- Notes his views apply to people without ultra-specialized knowledge of financial instruments
- Torn between "whittling" on small app and engaging with AI's societal implications
- Sees potential for both soft landing (cancer cure, poverty alleviation) and hard crash landing
- Admits to "irrational" decisions for psychological reasons while advocating rational framework

**Timeline Expectations:**

- Voice acting: jobs disappearing "within the next few years"
- LLM capabilities: "another 18 months, it's going to be incredible"
- General disruption: imminent enough to warrant immediate preparation
- Plumbing automation: "might be just a few years behind" language tasks

**Philosophical Underpinnings:**

- Values human dignity and inclusion (Down syndrome grocery employee example)
- Believes in capitalism but with limits
- Prioritizes daily experience over achievement/status
- Advocates for proactive self-disruption
- Emphasizes psychological factors in decision-making
- Concerned about social stability and inequality
- Hopeful about technology's potential if distributed well

This conversation represents a nuanced, experienced perspective from someone who has worked at the highest levels of tech and AI development, combining technical insight with humanistic concerns about society's ability to adapt to unprecedented change.
