I've created a comprehensive summary of the interview with Henry Ellenbogen. The interview covers his investment philosophy at Durable Capital Partners, which centers on identifying the rare 1% of stocks that compound at 20%+ annually. Key themes include the importance of "Act 2" entrepreneurs, understanding AI as "digital Kaizen" for knowledge work, the enduring value of public markets for building great companies, and his firm's unique structure that follows companies from private rounds through their public market journey.
