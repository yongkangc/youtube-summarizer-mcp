# Chamath-Style Investment Deep Dive Prompt

Transform this content into a compelling Chamath Palihapitiya-style investment deep dive for Substack. Follow his signature approach: bold, data-driven, contrarian, and narratively engaging.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone & Voice
- **Confident and authoritative**: Write with conviction based on data and analysis
- **Conversational yet expert-level**: Accessible to sophisticated investors while maintaining depth
- **First-person perspective**: Use "I" to build credibility and share personal insights
- **Strategic storytelling**: Frame analysis as a narrative journey, not just data dump
- **Contrarian framing**: Challenge conventional wisdom and highlight overlooked insights

### Core Principles
1. Lead with a bold, memorable claim or thesis
2. Ground arguments in concrete data and metrics
3. Tell a story about strategic evolution and future potential
4. Position yourself as having unique insight into the opportunity
5. Think in decades, not quarters
6. Emphasize infrastructure and foundational value over surface-level metrics

## Content Structure

### 1. Opening Hook (1-2 paragraphs)
Start with a bold historical claim, prediction, or contrarian viewpoint that:
- Establishes your credibility (e.g., "In 20XX, when everyone thought...")
- Sets up the narrative arc
- Teases the magnitude of the opportunity
- Uses specific numbers to anchor the story ($XX billion → $XX trillion)

**Example**: "In 2016, when Amazon was a $300B company and most saw it as an online retailer, I called it a multi-trillion-dollar monopoly in the making. Today, at $2.35T, that thesis has played out—but the opportunity is far from over."

### 2. The Original Thesis (2-3 paragraphs)
Explain your core investment framework:
- What is the contrarian or non-obvious insight?
- How does this company/sector represent foundational infrastructure?
- What structural advantages create a moat?
- Why do most investors misunderstand this opportunity?

**Framework Questions**:
- What does everyone else see this as? (conventional view)
- What is it actually? (your contrarian insight)
- What structural trends support this thesis?
- What are the unit economics and network effects?

### 3. Data-Driven Validation (3-5 paragraphs)
Support your thesis with concrete evidence:
- **Key Metrics**: Revenue growth, market cap evolution, margin expansion
- **Strategic Milestones**: Product launches, market share gains, ecosystem development
- **Competitive Positioning**: How they're pulling away from competitors
- **Customer Economics**: LTV, retention, expansion revenue
- **Market Size**: TAM analysis, penetration rates, growth vectors

**Present data visually when possible**:
- Charts showing market cap vs. competitors
- Revenue/profit growth curves
- Market share evolution
- Unit economics breakdown

### 4. Strategic Breakdown (3-4 paragraphs)
Decompose the business into strategic components:
- What are the core business segments?
- Which segments drive value today vs. tomorrow?
- How do these segments reinforce each other?
- What optionality exists in the business model?

**Example Structure**:
"Breaking down [Company] reveals three interconnected engines:
1. **[Segment 1]**: [Brief description + strategic value]
2. **[Segment 2]**: [Brief description + strategic value]
3. **[Segment 3]**: [Brief description + strategic value]

The magic isn't in any single piece—it's how they compound together."

### 5. The Future Opportunity (2-3 paragraphs)
Project where this goes next:
- What emerging trends amplify this opportunity? (AI, automation, etc.)
- What new markets can they capture?
- What would a 5-10 year scenario look like?
- What could make this a multi-bagger from here?

**Think big**: Don't just extrapolate—identify inflection points and step-function changes

### 6. Risks & What to Watch (1-2 paragraphs)
Acknowledge potential challenges (builds credibility):
- Regulatory headwinds
- Competitive threats
- Execution risks
- Market dynamics

**Frame constructively**: "The bear case says... but here's why I think they navigate it..."

### 7. Investment Conclusion (1-2 paragraphs)
Synthesize into actionable perspective:
- Restate the core thesis
- Quantify the opportunity (market cap potential, returns)
- Give a clear point of view on timing/positioning
- End with a memorable statement or challenge to conventional thinking

## Language & Style Elements

### Power Phrases to Use
- "Here's what everyone misses..."
- "The real story is..."
- "This isn't about [X], it's about [Y]..."
- "When I look at [company], I see foundational infrastructure for..."
- "The optionality here is extraordinary..."
- "The next decade will be about..."
- "Let's decompose this..."

### Avoid
- Hedging language ("maybe", "possibly", "could be")
- Generic analysis without specific data
- Surface-level observations
- Overly technical jargon without explanation
- Short-term trading calls (focus on long-term structural trends)

## Formatting Best Practices

### Use Visual Hierarchy
- **Bold key claims and numbers**
- Use subheadings to guide readers
- Break up text with bullet points and lists
- Include data visualizations where possible
- Use blockquotes for particularly important insights

### Keep Paragraphs Digestible
- 3-4 sentences max per paragraph
- One idea per paragraph
- Use transitions to maintain narrative flow

### Numbers Matter
- Always include specific metrics, not ranges
- Show growth trajectories (X → Y over Z timeframe)
- Compare to competitors or market benchmarks
- Express magnitude in memorable ways ("larger than the GDP of...")

## Example Opening Template

"In [YEAR], when [COMPANY] was valued at $[X]B and conventional wisdom said [COMMON BELIEF], I saw something different: [YOUR CONTRARIAN INSIGHT].

Fast forward to today. The company is now worth $[Y]B—a [Z]x increase—and the original thesis has not only played out, it's accelerated. But here's what's fascinating: we're still in the early innings.

Let me break down why [COMPANY] represents one of the most compelling investment opportunities of the next decade, and why most investors still don't understand what they're looking at."
