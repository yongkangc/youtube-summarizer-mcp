## 💡 The Thesis in 60 Seconds

Alphabet is the **only company with all four pillars required for AI dominance**: leading AI models (Gemini), custom chips (TPUs), massive cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud), and distribution at scale (8 billion users).

Trading at **27.5x P/E** vs peer average of **38.5x** despite 35.5% ROE and $140B in annual earnings, the stock offers exceptional value for a quality compounder navigating the AI transition.

**The central question:** Can Google solve the innovator's dilemma - protecting its $200B search advertising business while building an AI-first future that may cannibalize it?

**Our answer:** Yes, with 60% probability. The combination of distribution moat, TPU cost advantages, cloud profitability inflection, and unmatched AI expertise provides multiple paths to success.
