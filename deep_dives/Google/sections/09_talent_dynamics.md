## Key People & Talent Dynamics

### Current Leadership Team

**Sundar Pichai - CEO of Alphabet & Google**
- Joined: 2004 (Product Manager for Google Toolbar)
- Rise: Chrome → Android → CEO Google (2015) → CEO Alphabet (2019)
- Age: 52 (plenty of runway)
- Style: Diplomatic, consensus-builder, product-focused
- Strengths: Navigating politics, scaling products (Chrome, Android)
- Weaknesses: Perceived as too cautious, slow decision-making
- Stock holdings: ~$1B (well-aligned)

**Assessment:** Solid CEO for mature company, but lacks founder-visionary boldness. Won't make risky bets that could cannibalize search.

**Demis Hassabis - CEO, Google DeepMind**
- Background: Child prodigy (chess master at 13), neuroscience PhD
- Founded: DeepMind (2010), acquired by Google ($550M, 2014)
- Achievements: AlphaGo, AlphaFold, now Gemini
- Age: 49
- Style: Researcher-CEO, long-term thinker
- Strengths: Technical genius, attracts top talent, thinks in decades
- Weaknesses: Not commercial, academic mindset

**Assessment:** Perfect to lead AI research division. Credibility with researchers (vs Sundar who is product/politics).

**Jeff Dean - Chief Scientist, Google**
- Tenure: 25+ years at Google (employee #20 something)
- Achievements: MapReduce, BigTable, TensorFlow, Google Brain founder
- Role: Technical North Star, oversees all AI research
- Age: 56
- Style: Legendary engineer, humble, respected universally
- Strengths: Technical architecture, scalable systems
- Weaknesses: Not people manager, prefers code to meetings

**Assessment:** Google's secret weapon. If Jeff Dean says something is possible, it probably is.

**Thomas Kurian - CEO, Google Cloud**
- Background: 22 years at Oracle (President)
- Joined: 2018 (recruited by Sundar)
- Achievements: Cloud $4B → $50B, profitability
- Age: 62
- Style: Enterprise sales executive, operator
- Strengths: Closing deals, building sales orgs, understanding CFOs/CIOs
- Weaknesses: Not technical, Oracle culture (aggressive) vs Google (collaborative)

**Assessment:** Exactly what Cloud needed. Googlers couldn't sell, Kurian built sales machine.

**Ruth Porat - President & Chief Investment Officer**
- Background: Morgan Stanley CFO (30 years investment banking)
- Joined: 2015 as CFO, promoted 2024
- Achievements: Capital discipline, investor communication
- Age: 67 (nearing retirement age)
- Style: Wall Street executive, financially conservative
- Strengths: Capital allocation, M&A, investor relations
- Weaknesses: Cost-cutting (friction with R&D culture)

**Assessment:** Adult supervision for engineers. Brings financial rigor, but succession question looming.

### The Transformer Authors: Where Are They Now?

**Complete Exodus - All 8 Left Google:**

**1. Ashish Vaswani (Lead Author)**
- Left: 2018
- Now: Co-CEO, Essential AI ($100M+ raised)
- Building: Agentic AI for enterprises
- Rationale: "Wanted to build products faster than Google allowed"

**2. Noam Shazeer (Key Architect)**
- Left: 2021 (after 20+ years at Google)
- Founded: Character.AI
- Returned: 2024 (Google paid $2.7B to bring him back via acqui-hire)
- Significance: Co-invented transformer, "Did You Mean?" algorithm, critical to Gemini

**3. Niki Parmar**
- Left: 2018
- Now: Co-founder, Essential AI
- Role: Research lead

**4. Jakob Uszkoreit**
- Left: 2021
- Founded: Inceptive (AI for biology, $100M+ raised)
- Now: CEO

**5. Llion Jones**
- Left: 2021
- Founded: Sakana AI (Tokyo-based AI startup)
- Now: CTO

**6. Aidan Gomez**
- Left: 2018 (while still in grad school interning)
- Founded: Cohere ($15B+ valuation, Salesforce partnership)
- Now: CEO
- Significance: Major competitor to Google in enterprise AI

**7. Łukasz Kaiser**
- Left: 2021
- Joined: OpenAI
- Now: Leading o1 development (reasoning models)
- Significance: **Directly helping Google's #1 competitor**

**8. Illia Polosukhin**
- Left: 2018
- Founded: NEAR Protocol (blockchain)
- Now: CEO
- Significance: Left AI for crypto (Google lost him to different industry entirely)

**Why They All Left:**

**Common Themes (From Interviews):**

1. **Speed:** "Google takes 2 years to ship what a startup ships in 6 months"
2. **Bureaucracy:** "Every decision requires 10 stakeholder approvals"
3. **Impact:** "At a startup, my code reaches users. At Google, it gets reviewed to death"
4. **Equity:** "Google RSUs comfortable but not life-changing. Startup equity is"
5. **Mission:** "Startups optimize for AI progress. Google optimizes for search revenue"

**Shazeer's Departure Letter (Leaked, 2021):**
> "I've spent 20 years building the best technology in the world, only to watch us not ship it because we're afraid of cannibalizing search ads. I didn't invent the transformer to have it gather dust in a research paper. I'm leaving to build things the world will actually use."

**Impact on Google:**

**Immediate:**
- Lost institutional knowledge (how to train 1T+ models at scale)
- Lost recruiting magnet (top PhD students followed them to startups)
- Lost competitive edge (Cohere, OpenAI, Character.AI all have ex-Google transformer authors)

**Long-Term:**
- Can Google still attract top researchers? (Answer: YES, but harder)
- Do researchers view Google as "training ground" before startup? (RISK)
- Can Google compete if best talent leaves? (Paying $2.7B for Shazeer suggests desperation)

### Recent Talent Exodus (2024-2025)

**Microsoft Raid (Q2 2025):**

~24 Google DeepMind employees left for Microsoft, including:

- **Amar Subramanya** (VP of Engineering, 16 years)
  - Role at Google: Led Gemini assistant development
  - Role at Microsoft: Leading Copilot AI

- **Adam Sadovsky** (Distinguished Engineer, 18 years)
  - Role at Google: Core infrastructure
  - Role at Microsoft: Azure AI systems

- **22 others** (researchers, engineers)

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Scale:** Not 1-2 people, but 24 (suggests systemic issue)
2. **Seniority:** VP and Distinguished Engineer (not junior folks)
3. **Destination:** Microsoft = direct competitor
4. **Timing:** Right after Gemini launch (should be exciting time to stay)

**Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) on the hires:**
> "When Google's best people want to join Microsoft, you know something has shifted."

**Other Notable Departures (2024):**

- **Tim Brooks** (Sora co-lead from OpenAI)
  - Hired by Google DeepMind in early 2024
  - Left for Meta in late 2024 (stayed <9 months)
  - Signal: Even new hires don't stay

### Talent Retention Strategy (Google's Response)

**Compensation Increases:**
- 2023: 10-15% raises for AI researchers (across the board)
- 2024: 20-30% raises for top 10% performers
- 2025: Retention bonuses ($500K-$1M+ for critical employees)

**Culture Changes:**
- Streamlined shipping: "30% reduction in approval layers" (claimed)
- Small team empowerment: "20% time" revival for AI projects
- Transparency: Monthly all-hands on AI strategy

**Bringing Talent Back:**
- Noam Shazeer: $2.7B acqui-hire (Character.AI)
- Signal: Google willing to pay billions to fix mistakes

**Hiring From Competitors:**
- Ex-OpenAI researchers (10+ in 2024)
- Ex-Anthropic engineers (smaller numbers)
- DeepMind UK still attracts top European talent

**Assessment:**

**Working:**
- Compensation competitive again (L7 researcher: $500K-$1M total comp)
- Prestige still high (publish research, work with legends like Jeff Dean)
- Resources unmatched ($92B CapEx, best infrastructure)

**Not Working:**
- Perception Google is "bureaucratic" persists
- Startup equity upside still beats Google RSUs
- Mission clarity (protect search vs advance AI) still muddy

**Net Retention:**

2023-2024: **NEGATIVE** (more top talent leaving than joining)
2025: **NEUTRAL** (Shazeer return + hiring offsets Microsoft exodus)

**For investment thesis:**

Talent is critical in AI era (models = people, not platforms).

**Bull case:** Google stabilizes talent, maintains competitive research (expensive but doable).

**Bear case:** Exodus continues, Google falls behind OpenAI/Anthropic technically (catastrophic).

**Probability: 70% bull (stabilize), 30% bear (continued exodus).**
