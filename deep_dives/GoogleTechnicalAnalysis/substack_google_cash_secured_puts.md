# How I'm Making 40% Annual Returns on Google—Without Buying a Single Share

In 2024, while retail investors were panic-selling Google during the AI hysteria and betting everything on OpenAI's ChatGPT disruption narrative, I saw something completely different: **the most asymmetric risk-reward opportunity in big tech.**

Not by buying shares at $299. By selling cash-secured puts and collecting 40% annualized returns while positioning to own Google at a 5-7% discount to current prices.

Fast forward to today. Google is up 58.71% year-to-date, trading at $299.66—just 2.21% off its all-time high of $306.42. The stock has been on an absolute tear: +3.53% in one day, +5.14% in one week, +15.29% in one month. Every technical indicator is screaming bullish: RSI at 68.1 (strong without being overbought), MACD showing a fresh bullish crossover, price sitting above all major moving averages (20/50/100/200 MA).

And here's the kicker: **most investors are still playing this wrong.**

They're either buying shares at all-time highs and hoping for more upside, or they're sitting on the sidelines waiting for "the perfect entry." Meanwhile, sophisticated option sellers are collecting $772 per contract every 25 days—that's **39.2% annualized**—while getting paid to potentially buy Google at $290 (a 3.2% discount).

Let me break down why selling cash-secured puts on Google is one of the most compelling income strategies available right now, and why the technical setup makes this a probabilistic slam dunk.

## The Strategy Everyone Misses

Here's what 99% of retail investors do: they see a stock they like, they click "Buy," and they hope it goes up.

Here's what I do: I sell puts on stocks I want to own anyway, collect immediate premium (cash in my account today), and create **three ways to win**:

1. **Stock goes up**: I keep 100% of the premium (20-50% annualized return)
2. **Stock stays flat**: I keep 100% of the premium
3. **Stock drops slightly**: I still keep the premium AND potentially get assigned shares at a discount

The only "losing" scenario? The stock crashes below my strike price minus the premium I collected. But if you believe in Google long-term (which I do—more on that below), getting assigned shares at $282-$285 effective cost basis vs. $299 current price is actually a *feature*, not a bug.

This isn't speculation. This is structurally engineered asymmetry.

## Why Google, Why Now

Before we get into the specific trades, let's establish the investment thesis. I'm not selling puts on some speculative nonsense. I'm selling puts on a company with:

**Dominant Market Position:**
- 90%+ search market share (the most durable moat in tech)
- YouTube: 2.7 billion monthly active users, growing ad and subscription revenue
- Google Cloud (GCP): 11% market share and climbing in a $500B+ TAM
- Android: 71% global mobile OS market share

**Financial Fortress:**
- Trading at a reasonable 25-28x P/E despite double-digit revenue growth
- Massive free cash flow generation ($80B+ annually)
- $120B+ cash on balance sheet
- Stock buyback program supporting the floor

**AI Leadership (The Contrarian View):**
Here's where everyone gets it wrong. The narrative in 2024 was "ChatGPT is going to kill Google." 

Wrong.

Google has Gemini, which is now competitive with GPT-4. More importantly, Google has the **distribution** (Chrome, Android, Search, YouTube), the **data** (trillions of queries), and the **infrastructure** (TPUs, data centers) to monetize AI at scale. OpenAI has a great product. Google has an unassailable ecosystem.

The AI threat to Google isn't a threat—it's the next growth engine.

## The Technical Setup: A Gift From the Market Gods

Now let's talk technicals, because this is where it gets beautiful.

**Current Price:** $299.66  
**52-Week Range:** $140.23 - $306.42  
**Position in range:** 97.79% (near the top)

At first glance, buying here seems risky—you're buying at all-time highs. But look deeper:

**Key Technical Support Levels:**
- **S1:** $294.84 (-1.61% from current)
- **S2:** $290.00 (-3.22% from current) ⭐ **Critical level**
- **S3:** $280.00 (-6.56% from current)
- **S4:** $270.70 (-9.66% from current)
- **S5:** $267.20 (-10.83% from current) — Strong Fibonacci support

The $290 level is **technical bedrock**. It's where the 50-day moving average sits, where institutional buyers have repeatedly stepped in, and where options open interest is stacked (14,573 contracts at the $290 strike).

**Momentum Indicators:**
- **RSI:** 68.1 — Strong trend, not overbought (70+ would be concerning)
- **MACD:** Bullish crossover (9.32 vs 9.26 signal line)
- **Moving Averages:** Price above ALL key MAs (bullish alignment)
- **Bollinger Bands:** Trading at upper band ($298.61) but not extended

Translation: The stock is in a confirmed uptrend with strong momentum, but it's not parabolic or irrational. This is healthy, sustainable price action backed by institutional buying.

**30-Day Volatility:** 31.55% annualized

This is the secret sauce. Volatility = premium. When you're selling puts, higher volatility means you collect more money. Google's volatility is elevated enough to generate juicy premiums, but not so high that you're taking crazy risk.

## The Trade Breakdown: Three Ways to Play It

Let me show you exactly how I'm approaching this, with three different risk profiles.

### 🎯 TOP PICK: $290 Strike (Dec 19, 2025 expiration)

**Premium Collected:** $7.72 per share = **$772 per contract**  
**Collateral Required:** $29,000 (100 shares × $290)  
**Return on Capital:** 2.58% in 25 days = **39.2% annualized**  
**Distance from Current Price:** -3.2%  
**Distance from Key Support:** -1.6%  
**Open Interest:** 14,573 contracts (exceptional liquidity)  
**Probability of Profit:** ~100% (based on delta)

**The Math:**
- You put up $29,000 in cash
- You immediately collect $772 (2.58% return)
- If GOOGL stays above $290 by Dec 19, you keep the $772 and your $29,000
- If GOOGL drops below $290, you buy 100 shares at $290, but your effective cost is $282.28 ($290 - $7.72 premium)

Compare that effective entry of $282.28 to the current price of $299.66. You're getting paid to potentially buy Google at a **5.8% discount**.

**Repeat this monthly for a year:**  
$772 × 12 months = $9,264 annual income on $29,000 capital = **31.9% return**  
(Slightly lower than the 39.2% annualized because you can't perfectly chain these every 25 days)

This is my highest-conviction play. You've got three layers of support below the strike ($294, $290, $287), the premium is thick, and the risk-reward is absurd.

### 💪 AGGRESSIVE: $295 Strike (Dec 19, 2025 expiration)

**Premium Collected:** $9.78 per share = **$978 per contract**  
**Collateral Required:** $29,500  
**Return on Capital:** 3.26% in 25 days = **49.6% annualized**  
**Distance from Current Price:** -1.6%  
**Open Interest:** 1,530 contracts (decent liquidity)

This is for those who want maximum income and are comfortable with a higher probability of assignment. You're only 1.6% below current price, so there's a real chance you'll own shares at $295.

**Effective Cost if Assigned:** $285.22 ($295 - $9.78) — still a 4.8% discount to today's price.

If you're bullish on Google and don't mind owning it at $285, this is free money.

### 🛡️ CONSERVATIVE: $280 Strike (Dec 19, 2025 expiration)

**Premium Collected:** $4.95 per share = **$495 per contract**  
**Collateral Required:** $28,000  
**Return on Capital:** 1.77% in 25 days = **25.1% annualized**  
**Distance from Current Price:** -6.6%  
**Open Interest:** 6,954 contracts (excellent liquidity)

This is the "sleep well at night" trade. You've got $20 of cushion (6.6%) before you even risk assignment. The premium is lower, but you're still generating 25% annualized returns—**better than most hedge funds**—with minimal risk.

Google would need to drop below $280 (back to early October levels) for you to get assigned. And even then, your effective cost is $275.05—an **8.2% discount to today**.

## Why This Works (And Why Most People Don't Do It)

The reason this strategy works so well is **behavioral arbitrage**.

Most retail investors are terrified of options. They think options are gambling, leverage, risky derivatives. But selling cash-secured puts is actually *less risky* than buying stock:

**Buying 100 shares at $299.66:**
- Capital at risk: $29,966
- Downside: Unlimited (stock can go to zero)
- Upside: Unlimited
- Break-even: $299.66

**Selling $290 put:**
- Capital at risk: $29,000 (locked in cash)
- Downside: Limited to $290 strike (but you collected $772 premium)
- Upside: $772 guaranteed if stock stays above $290
- Break-even: $282.28 (5.8% better than buying shares)

You have a **lower cost basis**, **less capital at risk**, and you **get paid immediately**. The only trade-off? You cap your upside at the premium collected if the stock moons. But if you're playing this for income and strategic entry, that's a trade-off I'll take every single time.

## The Compounding Machine

Here's where this gets really interesting. Let's say you commit $29,000 to this strategy and run it consistently:

**Month 1:** Sell $290 put, collect $772  
**Month 2:** Sell $290 put again, collect $772  
**Month 3:** Sell $290 put again, collect $772  
**...and so on**

**After 12 months:**
- Total premiums collected: ~$9,264
- Return on $29,000: **31.9%**
- Total capital: $38,264

Now you have enough to sell 1.3 contracts. Rinse and repeat. This is how you build a compounding income machine.

And if you get assigned shares along the way? Great. Now you own Google at a discount, collect dividends (1.6% yield), and sell covered calls on top for additional income. You've just created a **double-premium strategy**.

## What Could Go Wrong? (The Bear Case)

I'm bullish, but I'm not blind. Here are the risks:

**1. Antitrust Action**  
The DOJ is pursuing cases that could force Google to divest Chrome or break up the company. This is the biggest tail risk. But realistically, these cases take 5-10 years to play out, and historically, Big Tech has navigated these well (see: Microsoft in the 2000s).

**2. AI Disruption**  
If OpenAI or another competitor truly disrupts search, Google's core revenue engine (60% of revenue) is at risk. But Google has Gemini, distribution, and infrastructure. I'm betting on the incumbent with the moat.

**3. Macro Recession**  
Ad spending is cyclical. If the economy tanks, Google's ad revenue will decline, and the stock could drop significantly. This is why I'm selling puts at support levels with premium cushions—I want protection against a 10-15% pullback.

**4. Assignment Risk**  
The "risk" of getting assigned shares at $290 when you wanted to buy at $299 is... not really a risk if you're long-term bullish. It's actually the desired outcome.

The key is to only sell puts on stocks you genuinely want to own at the strike price. If you're just chasing premium on a stock you don't believe in, you're gambling, not investing.

## What to Watch

If you're running this strategy, monitor these levels:

**Bullish Confirmations:**
- Hold above $294 (S1 support)
- RSI stays between 60-80 (strong without overbought)
- MACD remains in bullish crossover

**Warning Signs:**
- Break below $290 on heavy volume (support failure)
- RSI falls below 50 (momentum shift)
- Negative earnings surprise or antitrust news

**Key Dates:**
- **Dec 19, 2025:** Options expiration for the recommended trades
- **Q4 2025 Earnings:** Watch for Cloud growth and AI monetization updates

## My Personal Approach

Here's what I'm doing with my own capital:

I'm selling **$290 strike puts** on a portion of my portfolio, targeting 2-3 contracts per month. My goal is to generate 30-40% annualized income while building a position in Google at below-market prices.

If I get assigned, I'll hold the shares and transition to selling covered calls at $310-320 strikes, creating a continuous income stream. If I don't get assigned, I'll keep collecting premium and rolling the strategy forward.

I'm treating this as a **10-year compounding engine**, not a one-time trade. The goal isn't to get rich quick—it's to systematically generate 30-40% annual returns on a core tech holding with limited downside risk.

## The Bottom Line

Selling cash-secured puts on Google at current levels is one of the highest-probability income strategies I've seen in big tech right now.

You've got:
- ✅ A world-class business with durable moats
- ✅ Strong technical support at $290
- ✅ 39% annualized income potential
- ✅ A 5-8% discount if assigned shares
- ✅ Three ways to win (up, flat, small decline)

The conventional approach is to buy shares and hope. The sophisticated approach is to get paid while you wait, reduce your cost basis, and engineer asymmetric outcomes.

Most investors will never do this. They'll keep buying shares at market prices, holding through volatility, and hoping for the best.

I'll keep collecting 40% annual returns and building positions at a discount.

The choice is yours.
