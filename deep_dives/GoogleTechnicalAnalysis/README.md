## Recommended Action Plan

### For Moderate Risk Tolerance (RECOMMENDED)

**Goal:** Collect premium with reasonable downside protection

1. **Sell $290 Puts** expiring Dec 19 (24 DTE)
   - Collect $7.72/share ($772 per contract)
   - Set aside $29,000 cash per contract
   - If assigned: Own GOOGL at $290 (great entry price!)

2. **Position Sizing:**
   - Start with 1-3 contracts depending on portfolio size
   - Keep capital available for potential assignment
   - Don't over-leverage

3. **Management:**
   - **Take Profit:** Close at 50-70% profit (premium decay accelerates)
   - **Roll:** If challenged, roll down and out for credit
   - **Accept Assignment:** If GOOGL fundamentals still strong

4. **Exit Rules:**
   - Close if GOOGL breaks below $270 (fundamentals changed)
   - Take profit if premium decays to $2-3 (75% gain)
   - Roll if threatened with assignment and still bullish

### For Aggressive Traders

1. **Sell $295 Puts** for maximum premium ($9.78)
2. Accept higher assignment risk
3. Be ready to own stock at $295 (only 1.6% below current)

### For Conservative Traders

1. **Sell $280 Puts** for safety ($4.95)
2. Sleep well with 6.6% cushion
3. Still earn 25% annualized return

---

## Risk Management

### Stop Loss / Exit Triggers

Set these rules BEFORE entering the trade:

1. **Technical Break:** Close if GOOGL closes below $265 (breaks all support)
2. **Fundamental Change:** Exit if Google reports poor earnings or macro deteriorates
3. **Profit Target:** Close at 50-75% max profit
4. **Time Decay:** Consider closing with <7 days to expiration if still profitable

### Position Sizing Guidelines

- **Per Trade:** Risk no more than 2-5% of portfolio per put contract
- **Total Exposure:** Don't exceed 20-30% of portfolio in put obligations
- **Cash Requirement:** Must have cash to cover assignment ($29,000 per contract at $290 strike)

### What If You Get Assigned?

**Good News:** You wanted to own Google anyway!

- You'll own GOOGL at $290 (or your strike price)
- That's a 3.2% discount from current price ($299.66)
- You keep the premium ($7.72), lowering your cost basis to $282.28
- Average cost: $290 - $7.72 = **$282.28 effective entry**

**Then You Can:**
1. Hold the stock (you're bullish!)
2. Sell covered calls to generate more income
3. Sell for profit if price rebounds

## Options Chain Data Summary

### Implied Volatility Analysis

| Metric | Value |

| 60-Day Historical Vol | 32.52% |
| 1-Year Historical Vol | 33.09% |
| Average Put IV (ATM) | ~32% |

## Calendar Strategy (Optional)

### Rolling Strategy for Continuous Income

Instead of one-time trades, consider **monthly put selling** for consistent income:

1. **Sell $290 puts** every month (30-45 DTE)
2. **Close at 50% profit** or let expire worthless
3. **Repeat:** Collect premium monthly

**Example Annual Returns (if never assigned):**
- $290 strike @ $7.72/month = **$92.64/year** per share
- As % of capital at risk ($290): **31.9% annual return**
- Actual returns will vary month to month

## Macro & Fundamental Considerations

### Why Google Is Bullish (Fundamental Support)

While this is a technical analysis, fundamentals matter for put selling:

1. **AI Leadership:** Google's Gemini AI, cloud AI services
2. **Search Dominance:** 90%+ market share, durable moat
3. **Cloud Growth:** GCP gaining share, high-margin business
4. **YouTube:** Advertising + subscription revenue growth
5. **Waymo:** Self-driving leadership, long-term optionality
6. **Valuation:** Trading at ~25-28x P/E (reasonable for quality + growth)

### Risks to Monitor

- **Antitrust:** DOJ cases could force breakup (tail risk)
- **Competition:** OpenAI/ChatGPT disrupting search
- **Macro:** Ad spending sensitive to recession
- **Regulation:** Privacy laws could impact ad targeting

**Bottom Line:** Strong fundamentals support selling puts. You'd be happy to own GOOGL at a discount.
